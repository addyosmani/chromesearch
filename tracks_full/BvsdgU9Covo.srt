00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,410

2
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,930
IDO GREEN: Welcome to another
episode of GDL Israel.

3
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,455
Today we have Nissim
Betito with us.

4
00:00:19,455 --> 00:00:21,570
Thank you for coming and
joining, of course.

5
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:21,930
NISSIM BETITO: Thank you.

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,300
IDO GREEN: And without further
ado, we promise you that we

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,320
jump into what ChromeOS is
basically allowing developers

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,632
and hackers, in the
current state.

9
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:35,020
Quite different, the world
that we have today

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,630
from pixel to others.

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,000
And how you could basically
develop and write code when

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,130
you're using Chromebook.

13
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,910
So there are two or three
slides that we prepared.

14
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,040
Let's share them.

15
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:56,540
And first and foremost, it's
quite clear that today with

16
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,710
all the movement to the cloud
we see more and more IDEs

17
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,220
basically allowing you
great functionality.

18
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,920
And lets you be productive when
you're working with your

19
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,060
Chromebook.

20
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,140
Cloud9, ShiftEdit, Neutron
Drive, all of them are working

21
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,620
with Google Drive.

22
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,030
Some of them are a nice
integration with Dropbox.

23
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,820
And Cloud9, for instance, is
letting you work with GitHub.

24
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,060
Repositories.

25
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:23,710
So it's very easy and very
straightforward to work with,

26
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,980
when you have your Chromebook.

27
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,420
Let me try and basically share
with you my Cloud9

28
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,670
environment.

29
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,040

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,930
And as you can see, I already
installed it.

31
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:43,500
So you can see that I have the
option to launch the app from

32
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,880
Chrome Web Store.

33
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,700
And basically when I'm launching
the app, I have here

34
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,900
a nice dashboard that
I could open.

35
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,310
And because we don't have too
much time, I'll just open

36
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,870
immediately a project
that I already did.

37
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,210
Now the beauty here is that
the project is hosted on

38
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,800
GitHub, so if you want to have
nice collaboration with your

39
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,450
teammates you could
definitely do so.

40
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:06,670
And here in the file, you have a
full blown IDE that lets you

41
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,539
use your keyboard with nice
shortcuts, for people that are

42
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:11,830
used to different IDEs.

43
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,350
And with some nice things that
are suggesting how to improve

44
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,730
and make our code
more readable.

45
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,520
Of course you could run it later
on, and there are some

46
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,740
very, very cool capabilities
that Cloud9 specifically

47
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,300
letting you know.

48
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:33,230
Using HTML5 client side offline
APIs from file, to

49
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,460
local storage, to IndexedDB.

50
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:39,180
And it's quite nice to see how
they're leveraging it.

51
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,210
Other options, and quite a lot
of options that you can see

52
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:47,270
here, are some that are hosted
on Google Cloud.

53
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,200
Some are not.

54
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,020
And we highly encourage you just
to check and see what is

55
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,890
the best tool to accomplish
your job.

56
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,820
So one option is just to take
and use a current IDE that you

57
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,350
have out there.

58
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:03,110
But for the ones that want to
hack a little bit more and

59
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:08,320
feel what ChromeOS looks like,
we do have the options to run

60
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,080
ChromeOS in VirtualBox.

61
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,990
And actually in VMware
as well.

62
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:16,710
So we'll put this slide
up there after

63
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,560
we finish the show.

64
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,810
But you have your link to a
blog post that I wrote,

65
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,870
actually now it's almost
two years--

66
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,970
a year and a half.

67
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,930
And basically it lets you test
drive ChromeOS in VirtualBox.

68
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,760
Quite nice, and you could
get the feeling of

69
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,040
how it looks like.

70
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,380
And what things you
could do with it.

71
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,010
Other good option for people
that like to hack with

72
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:40,540
hardware is to install ChromeOS
on the SD card.

73
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:46,140
And then run it side by side
with your Chromebooks.

74
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,460
For instance you could install
Ubuntu or any other version of

75
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:53,420
Linux on the SD card, and have
the ability to work on

76
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,520
ChromeOS with the online IDEs.

77
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,690
Or just launch and have another
operation system that

78
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,110
is installed on the
Chromebook.

79
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,360
And if it's-- in our case,
we'll show you Ubuntu--

80
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,500
you have everything there from
Java to LAMP, Apache, MySQL,

81
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,630
all the things that you want.

82
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,510
And [? at the end of
the day it's ?]

83
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:11,810
Ubuntu.

84
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,990
So you could go and get
pretty wild with it.

85
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,760
For the brave ones, you could
just install side by side the

86
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,394
operations system and have a
full blown dual boot machine.

87
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:25,140
Or just install [INAUDIBLE].

88
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:30,020
So the last thing is that of
course before you are going

89
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,530
and want to hack your
Chromebook, you must enter

90
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,460
development mode.

91
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,190
The good thing about it
is that you will be

92
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,140
able to exit it.

93
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,160
So you won't ruin your
Chromebook in

94
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,920
case things are scary.

95
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,320
How to enter development mode.

96
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,150
So are the three steps.

97
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,380
But we'll put the first links
that just elaborate and show

98
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,530
you exact step by step what
you need to do in

99
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,893
order to enter it.

100
00:04:54,893 --> 00:04:57,900
After you enter the development
mode, there are a

101
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,305
few steps that basically pull
from GitHub and operations

102
00:05:01,305 --> 00:05:07,440
that customize citron that
lets you run Ubuntu on

103
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,270
Chromebook.

104
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:15,410
And how you do it and how it
looks like, we'll just let

105
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,980
Nissim explain to us how
we did this magic.

106
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,480
So let's stop the
screen sharing.

107
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,570
And do you want to
move the camera?

108
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:25,845
OK, first explain, and then.

109
00:05:25,845 --> 00:05:26,120
OK.

110
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,710
NISSIM BETITO: Yeah.

111
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,760
So hey guys.

112
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:34,550
In the end the main goal is to
just, at least as I prefer to

113
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,180
do, a side by side
installation.

114
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,290
That way you know that
you don't damage your

115
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,990
hardware in any way.

116
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,480
And then it's an easy way to
create if you like to develop

117
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,450
or to use it for all kinds of
purpose to create an SD card.

118
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,020
It's really cheap.

119
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,090
You're just creating
all kinds of Ubuntu

120
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,890
flavor on your SD card.

121
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,950
What we have here today
is a [INAUDIBLE]

122
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,130
machine.

123
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,820
The Samsung I5 Chromebook.

124
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,780

125
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,750
I already turned it on to
the development mode.

126
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,210
And I changed that.

127
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,578
And if they will hold the
camera for a second.

128
00:06:12,578 --> 00:06:13,035
IDO GREEN: Yeah.

129
00:06:13,035 --> 00:06:13,950
I'll take the camera out.

130
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:17,110
And we'll just flip, and
see the nice views.

131
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,100

132
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,170
NISSIM BETITO: So I inserted the
SD card into the laptop.

133
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:28,300
In the end what we are going
to do after developer mode.

134
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,510
If I turn the machine you can
see the screen that is showing

135
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,550
us that we are in
developer mode.

136
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,170
If we leave it like that it will
just start booting and go

137
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:43,420
to a kind of ChromeOS
questioning mode.

138
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,120
It will give you the option to
install your OS or to change

139
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,910
the version that you
are running.

140
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:53,700
But by pressing Control U on
the machine, it's basically

141
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:58,825
giving the OS the command to
change to a different SD card

142
00:06:58,825 --> 00:06:59,625
boot [? mode. ?]

143
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:03,010
IDO GREEN: We'll try to capture
that now the loading

144
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:03,890
script is on.

145
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,670
NISSIM BETITO: So exactly from
this step and on what we have

146
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:13,500
here is a regular Linux boot
mode that in a sec you will

147
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:19,160
see the Ubuntu 12.4
booting up.

148
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,090
And in that distribution that we
installed, we installed the

149
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:28,655
full Ubuntu OS straight
from the repository

150
00:07:28,655 --> 00:07:30,610
that we have online.

151
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,910
You have LibreOffice.

152
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:36,000
You have the regular stuff
that comes with Ubuntu.

153
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,130
It's recognizing your Wi-Fi,
your OS, graphic card.

154
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:40,860
Everything.

155
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,800
All the basic things that you
need for a Linux device.

156
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,530
As you can see we have Unity
running and presenting.

157
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,550
And we have also Chrome
on the machine.

158
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,480
IDO GREEN: So now we're running

159
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,110
Chrome inside ChromeOS.

160
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:54,780
NISSIM BETITO: Exactly.

161
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,493
IDO GREEN: Nice.

162
00:07:55,493 --> 00:07:57,730
Nice.

163
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,740
NISSIM BETITO: Few things that
I would recommend you to do

164
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,390
is, probably play little
bit with Linux.

165
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,830
If you want to try
it just move some

166
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,740
packages you don't need.

167
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:10,283
Or maybe just, in the end, take
a flavor that you know

168
00:08:10,283 --> 00:08:14,815
that you can develop on, and
play, as you would use to do

169
00:08:14,815 --> 00:08:15,920
on a regular laptop.

170
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,820
And again, this is Chromebook.

171
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:23,100
So it's very simple to go back,
as Ido said, to get out

172
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,730
from developer mode and
just to get back to

173
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,980
your original ChromeOS.

174
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,085
And it's so beautiful
that it's fast.

175
00:08:30,085 --> 00:08:31,010
It's at the press of a button.

176
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:35,539
And you don't need to do get any
special CD installation or

177
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:37,960
any other hardware to just
do these changes.

178
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,400
So as Ido said, it's
three simple steps.

179
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,010
Change to developer mode.

180
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:47,950
Insert your SD card and
recognize it in your laptop.

181
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,620
I tried at least a few SD
cards and USB dumps.

182
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,110
And ChromeOS and Chromebooks
basically

183
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,050
recognized all of them.

184
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:58,160
And just captured the image from
online and just throw it

185
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,700
on your SD card.

186
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,400
IDO GREEN: Now the good tip here
is to use SD card that

187
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,670
has at least 8 gig, right.

188
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:03,980
NISSIM BETITO: Exactly.

189
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,540
IDO GREEN: So it will have
a bit more memory.

190
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,910
And the other thing that you
need to remember is that it's

191
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,070
all without any warranty.

192
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,470
NISSIM BETITO: Yeah.

193
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,350
IDO GREEN: So you're downloading
scripts from the

194
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:18,890
web, put your best judgement
into place and make sure that

195
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,440
it's not a production laptop.

196
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,010
NISSIM BETITO: Exactly, yeah.

197
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:26,275
IDO GREEN: Another cool thing
that we'll show you in the

198
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:29,820
near future is what you did
with this little guy.

199
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,530
NISSIM BETITO: Yes, we have the
Raspberry Pi here with us.

200
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,720
And then another thing that we
tried also was running just

201
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,370
ChromeOS on Raspberry Pi.

202
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,960
It's basically ARM based
board that you have an

203
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,580
HDMI video in it.

204
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:49,010
And also doing network ports.

205
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:52,690
You have two USB ports only
and one network port.

206
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,160
You can do anything with it.

207
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,630
You can, as we did with the
Chromebook, just pushed an SD

208
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,030
card with Ubuntu flavor, we
can do the same thing with

209
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:10,680
Raspberry Pi but just with
ChromeOS on the Raspberry.

210
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,820
It's beautiful.

211
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,210
Again you have the SD slot.

212
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,780
So you can create as few
distribution and as much

213
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:21,580
distribution that you want
for any kind of software

214
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,620
development or installation that
you need in your office,

215
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,620
at home, or whatever
you need to.

216
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:31,236
And as Ido said, probably if you
want we can talk about it

217
00:10:31,236 --> 00:10:32,740
a little bit more
in the future.

218
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,540
And even show you
how it's done.

219
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,160
IDO GREEN: Yeah definitely.

220
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,290
And I think that the main
feedback that you gave was

221
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,640
that it was much slower than the
Chromebook itself, right.

222
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:39,930
NISSIM BETITO: Yes.

223
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:40,330
IDO GREEN: In terms of
the capabilities.

224
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,090
NISSIM BETITO: [INAUDIBLE]
yes.

225
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,230
IDO GREEN: But yeah, it's very,
very cool and of course,

226
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,084
much cheaper.

227
00:10:45,084 --> 00:10:45,940
NISSIM BETITO: Yeah.

228
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,660
IDO GREEN: Great.

229
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,140
So I think I will wrap
it up for this time.

230
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,580
We are extremely busy and have
lot of surprises for you for

231
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,330
next week at Google I/O. So for
the ones that aren't going

232
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:02,140
to be live there, just feel
free to watch the live

233
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,226
Hangouts, and the broadcast
that we'll of course have,

234
00:11:04,226 --> 00:11:06,040
like we do every year.

235
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,150
And until two weeks' time,
because next week we aren't

236
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:12,560
going to have our weekly show,
be strong and safe.

237
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,370
Thank you.

238
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:13,970
NISSIM BETITO: Bye guys.

239
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,220
IDO GREEN: Bye-bye.

240
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:20,437
