00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:04,240
What is PageSpeed Service and how does it
work?

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,769
Web pages today contain a lot more than HTML.
They combine stylesheets, images, videos,

3
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:15,009
Javascript files and other components to give
the rich interactive experience we now expect

4
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:16,250
on the web.

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:21,509
This means however that to display a web page,
a browser has to make several HTTP requests,

6
00:00:21,509 --> 00:00:26,220
as many as 43 requests for the average web
page, to fetch all these resources from the

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,480
server hosting your site.

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,610
Many such network requests to fetch files
one after another increases wait time and

9
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:39,410
slows down the page. Slow web pages can make
visitors to your site less engaged and even

10
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:43,420
frustrated, leading to lower conversion and
lost revenue.

11
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:48,300
Google PageSpeed Service is an online service
you can use to automatically speed up your

12
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:54,120
website. It rewrites web pages dynamically
to apply several performance-improving practices,

13
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,950
and then serves the optimized pages via Google
servers to reduce page load time.

14
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,870
When you first setup PageSpeed Service for
your site, you’ll be guided to change its

15
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:10,140
DNS entry so that your domain name points
to PageSpeed servers. Once completed, PageSpeed

16
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,470
servers will serve your web pages and intelligently
cache their resources to serve them to users

17
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:20,430
faster. They’ll also fetch newer content
from your original host server so that the

18
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,670
latest version of your website is always served
to users.

19
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:29,800
PageSpeed servers are located in Google operated
datacenters distributed around the world.

20
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,630
So your site will benefit from the speed,
efficiency and security of the same infrastructure

21
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,260
that powers all of Google.

22
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:42,409
PageSpeed rewriters use a combination of techniques
to optimize web pages. One of them is to reduce

23
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:47,860
the number and size of the resources to be
fetched. PageSpeed Service rewrites web pages

24
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:53,409
to merge and compress Javascript, stylesheet
and image files, and to parallelize the download

25
00:01:53,409 --> 00:02:00,070
of these files wherever possible. This means
fewer HTTP requests and lower round-trip times,

26
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,790
so your web page gets delivered to the browser
faster.

27
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:08,319
Another technique is to reduce the perceived
page load time. This is the minimum time that

28
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,730
users have to wait before they can view the
page.

29
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:16,709
The typical web page today is long and has
many visual elements. But only a small portion

30
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:21,519
of the page is initially visible in the browser
once the page has loaded.

31
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:26,069
PageSpeed Service can rewrite a web page so
that the parts of the page that users expect

32
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:31,989
to see first get downloaded first. This means
users can engage with your site right away,

33
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:36,980
without having to wait for the full page to
load. The rewriters can also cache parts of

34
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:41,189
the page that don’t change frequently so
they get delivered to the browser quickly

35
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:43,409
on future visits to your site.

36
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:48,859
This combination of advanced rewriter technology
and global serving infrastructure can dramatically

37
00:02:48,859 --> 00:02:54,909
reduce the load time of your web pages, often
by as much as 40%. Faster web pages improve

38
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:59,950
the experience of visitors to your site and
so can increase both traffic and customer

39
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,180
conversion.

40
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,309
So get started with PageSpeed Service today
and discover how fast your websites can be!
