[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,580
PETE LEPAGE: --Thursday.

3
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,080
I want to welcome Paul, who's
joining us from London.

4
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:13,950
Paul, you want to say hi?

5
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,290
PAUL KINLAN: Hi, guys.

6
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,310
PETE LEPAGE: Excellent.

7
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,760
So today's a kind of cool day.

8
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,430
Today's the first of a new
weekly series that we're going

9
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:25,670
to be starting for Mobile Web
Thursdays, where we're going

10
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,850
to be coming to you with all
kinds of really cool stuff

11
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,970
about mobile web development.

12
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,990
Today, we're going to focus on
the launch of Chrome for

13
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:37,630
Android, the latest build
that shipped yesterday.

14
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:42,860
Paul, do you want to tell us
a little bit about what's

15
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,324
special about this new build?

16
00:01:45,324 --> 00:01:46,280
PAUL KINLAN: What's special?

17
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:46,640
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

18
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,200
PAUL KINLAN: Everything.

19
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,840
It's actually a really exciting
build, right?

20
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,020
Because this is the first time
where we're getting close to

21
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,530
parity with the desktop.

22
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,160
We both wanted web developers
to have a first class

23
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,740
experience when developing
for the web,

24
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,180
across all factory devices.

25
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,800
And obviously in the past,
we've led with desktop.

26
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,449
And then, we launched,
I think 16, and then

27
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:11,140
upgraded to 18 on Android.

28
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,030
And now we're at 25, only a week
behind the actual desktop

29
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,820
launch, like version
25 Chrome.

30
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,590
So for me, that's the
most exciting thing.

31
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,310
Because developers are at
least starting to get

32
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,124
consistent platforms to target
across all form factors.

33
00:02:24,124 --> 00:02:25,050
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

34
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,320
I think that's sort of the
neatest thing for me, as well.

35
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:33,000
The fact that we are now on M
25, or only a week behind the

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,470
desktop build is
pretty awesome.

37
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,700
So if you haven't updated your
Chrome for Android on your

38
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,540
Android device, you
should go do that.

39
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,070
If you just go into the Play
store, if you haven't seen the

40
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,590
update pop up, and check for any
available updates so that

41
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,530
you can get that.

42
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,290
PAUL KINLAN: I actually think
you need a user permission

43
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,810
change, as well, for the audio
stuff, which we're going to

44
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,560
talk about later.

45
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,110
So if you see it sitting
there, press

46
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,520
update, and go ahead.

47
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:02,930
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

48
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,320
I think that we'll talk
about that in a bit.

49
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,080
But that's a really cool new
feature that I'm really

50
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,333
excited about.

51
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:11,730
So why don't we dive in and take
a look at some of the new

52
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,930
things that are available
in Chrome for Android.

53
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:20,410
So there's a couple of ones that
are kind of cool that are

54
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,500
a little bit harder to show.

55
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,620
But some of those are like,
improved scrolling

56
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,110
performance.

57
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,870
So I'm going to bring
up a page here.

58
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:33,140
And I'm just going to create a
new tab, and do a quick search

59
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:38,530
for how browsers work.

60
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,560
PAUL KINLAN: That's
a big doc, right?

61
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,820
PETE LEPAGE: And that's a
huge document, right?

62
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,670
So that's the one
on HTML5 Rocks.

63
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:51,000
So if I pull this guy up and
let it finish loading.

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,050
In the past, if you started
scrolling on here, what you'd

65
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:58,060
find would be that you'd get
big blank spots showing up.

66
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,680
You'd get pieces where content
just didn't render.

67
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,250
But now, notice that as I'm
scrolling, we're getting very

68
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,220
few of those blank spots--
and of course, as we

69
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,300
go through a demo.

70
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,570
But every once in a while, we
get these areas where we get

71
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,510
sort of blurred out text.

72
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,140
What's happening is the
browser's rendering low

73
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,950
quality images, effectively, so
that it can show and scroll

74
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,360
quickly so that we can see
what's going on, so that we

75
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,050
get a much better experience.

76
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:35,560
And we get a much smoother
scrolling experience going on.

77
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,150
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

78
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,610
So everyone knows, this is
like basically a threaded

79
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,250
compositor now.

80
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,255
So in the past, essentially,
paints and everything used to

81
00:04:42,255 --> 00:04:44,370
block the--

82
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,730
if you did a paint and then a
render, it would block the

83
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:49,010
actual browser for that time.

84
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:49,690
And now it doesn't.

85
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,830
It's on a completely
separate thread.

86
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,820
Internally, we called it
imple-side threading, or

87
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,000
imple-side painting,
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,660
It's like a completely
obtuse name.

89
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,910
But essentially, what it does
is exactly what Pete just

90
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,890
described, where you'll
do a scroll.

91
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,510
And we've got low resolution
versions of the page that's

92
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,010
all rendered out anyway.

93
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,190
We've got low resolution
versions of the page which we

94
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,340
can quickly show to the user.

95
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,020
And then when the scrolling
stops, we swap that out.

96
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,395
And we give it back to the
user in full, high res.

97
00:05:14,395 --> 00:05:16,490
And we think this is a better
way of doing it, because

98
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,630
that's one of the worst things
that we have at the moment on

99
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:22,660
the mobile web, is if you
scroll, you lose track of

100
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,420
everything.

101
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,330
The app would try to paint,
but the user wouldn't see

102
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,570
anything, because we
couldn't keep up.

103
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,240
And this is a big improvement
for the way that you develop

104
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,050
apps, or at least the
way that your users

105
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,070
see your site snaps.

106
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,630
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

107
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,700
This is a really cool one.

108
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,370
And it really is going to, I
think, increase the feeling

109
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,060
that users have of a responsive
browser and a

110
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,700
responsive website.

111
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,820
So that's one.

112
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:53,900
One of the next ones is really
sort of improved performance

113
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,820
in pinch to zoom sites.

114
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,780
So in sites where you're going
to go to them and you're going

115
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,530
to go and do pinch to zoom,
the performance there is

116
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:02,945
significantly improved.

117
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,450

118
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,110
Paul, do you want to talk
a little bit about that?

119
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,430
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

120
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:10,690
It's kind of hard to
show this off.

121
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,200
But I think it's basically a
benefit of having the threaded

122
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,190
compositor now.

123
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,830
The interesting thing, and we
found this out a couple of

124
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:21,260
weeks ago, is that we always
have this like 300 millisecond

125
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,543
delay on clicks.

126
00:06:22,543 --> 00:06:24,800
You click a link, or
click anything.

127
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,560
Obviously, it needs to work out
whether you're going to

128
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,270
try to do another
type of gesture.

129
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,930
And that whole subsystem's been
starting to be improved.

130
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,420
But the interesting thing is if
you have your viewport set,

131
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,050
which we might talk about
viewport today, but we

132
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,093
probably have a whole dedicated
session for

133
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:39,000
viewports in the future.

134
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,240
Because it's quite a
complex subject.

135
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,100
If you have your viewport set to
device width, then we don't

136
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,570
even do that 300 millisecond
delay.

137
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,261
Because we know that you're not
going to do another type

138
00:06:49,261 --> 00:06:49,894
of gesture.

139
00:06:49,894 --> 00:06:50,740
PETE LEPAGE: Right.

140
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,180
PAUL KINLAN: Because it's
impossible to do, basically.

141
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,050
So that's the whole subset of
performance improvements that

142
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,766
have been coming along with the
viewport and the page to

143
00:06:58,766 --> 00:07:00,600
zoom stuff and everything.

144
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,510
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, yeah.

145
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,860
I think that one's
pretty slick.

146
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,810
And that one's a nice user
improvement, as well.

147
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,390
PAUL KINLAN: In theory, it means
that you don't need to

148
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,110
use FastClick.

149
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,420
But obviously, every other
browser out there that is

150
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,280
using FastClick has this
other problem, as well.

151
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,340
So we'll probably see that
type of thing live for a

152
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,150
little while.

153
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,500
But the idea is that we want to
give you the ability just

154
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,610
to not have to use
that library.

155
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:21,870
PETE LEPAGE: Right.

156
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,610
And well, one of the things that
we were talking about a

157
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,670
couple weeks ago while we were
in London for Edge was talking

158
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,490
with the developers
of FastClick.

159
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,670
And talking about ways that we
could potentially detect

160
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:35,640
Chrome for Android with
the proper things set.

161
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,880
And if everything is set
properly, not even load

162
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,140
FastClick, so that it doesn't
even have to load.

163
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,740
There's less JavaScript
running on your page.

164
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,130
Your page is more responsive
because of that.

165
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,930
And your clicks happen pretty
much instantly.

166
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,610
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, yeah.

167
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,820
PETE LEPAGE: So I think that's
a pretty slick one.

168
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,160
There's also a whole bunch of
work that we did around making

169
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,670
sure that we had the latest
JavaScript engine.

170
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:05,970
So effectively, the previous
version of

171
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,330
Chrome was Chrome 18.

172
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:12,410
We've moved seven versions of
Chrome since then, and had

173
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,820
seven releases since
that initial time.

174
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:20,650
So we now have a much faster
JavaScript engine with all of

175
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,120
the latest V8 stuff in there.

176
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,370
Again, that one's a little
hard to demo, as well.

177
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,910
So don't really have a lot to
show there, but I think we

178
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,275
have something cool for the--

179
00:08:30,275 --> 00:08:32,419
PAUL KINLAN: I mean, people can
just go to the SunSpider

180
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:33,130
stuff if they want.

181
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,600
PETE LEPAGE: That's
a good point.

182
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,220
PAUL KINLAN: We've been talking
with Paul Lewis and a

183
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,080
couple of other guys as well,
internally, about the

184
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,370
JavaScript performance, OK, it's
a big factor in how your

185
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,790
application responds
to the users.

186
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,770
But bigger areas of improvement
that you could

187
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:47,840
potentially have as a developer
when you're

188
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,700
optimizing your site are
actually around rendering

189
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,970
paint, and actually not
forcing layouts.

190
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:56,150
Because obviously, the browsers
on mobile phones are,

191
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,270
in order of magnitude, slower
than desktop machines.

192
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:02,850
So we have a bigger benefit in
reducing the number of reflows

193
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,420
and recalcs and all those type
of things, than necessarily

194
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,640
the JavaScript stuff itself.

195
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,840
But that being said, we
are keeping parity.

196
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,960
And that's the aim, is to keep
parity with the desktop now.

197
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,290
So I think that's a really
powerful thing.

198
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,350
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

199
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:22,770
So now we've got another whole
set of features where we've

200
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,560
got some really cool demos.

201
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,280
If you want to follow along or
try any of these demos, we can

202
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,660
put the link on the screen
for the demos.

203
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,860
But you can see the link is
there, and you can try some of

204
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,710
these yourself.

205
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:38,040
So the first one I want to have
a quick peek at is the

206
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,270
audio demo.

207
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:43,720
And one of the big changes there
is now, audio will play

208
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,400
even if Chrome's in
the background.

209
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:50,790
And Paul had mentioned that
you need a background--

210
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,170
you need a user permission to
update Chrome for Android.

211
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,090
And this is why.

212
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:58,660
So if I were to go and say, hey,
I want to start playing

213
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,100
this podcast.

214
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,730
Which we'll go and
hit play here.

215
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,020
Sure enough, OK.

216
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,460
You can hear it in
the background.

217
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,770
Now, if I leave Chrome and go
somewhere else within my phone

218
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:14,120
and start doing other things,
the podcast keeps going.

219
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,270
So if I'm using something like
Google music to play music, if

220
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:21,750
I'm listening to podcasts or
doing anything else, all of

221
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,120
that music or all of that audio
still keeps playing,

222
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,140
even with Chrome not as
the primary piece.

223
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,370
So I can go and check
out some news, see

224
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:33,140
what's going on there.

225
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:38,430
It's a pretty slick and kind
of cool little feature.

226
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,060
Paul, do you have anything you
want to add to this one?

227
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,650
PAUL KINLAN: No, this actually,
so this is--

228
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,840
I think we're playing the HM
part as well, I think.

229
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,870
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

230
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,210
PAUL KINLAN: This is actually
a feature that Mike

231
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,750
[INAUDIBLE] wanted
quite a long time

232
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,740
ago inside the browser.

233
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,900
He's had a bug open for
it for quite a while.

234
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,310
And we finally have been able to
actually fix it, because of

235
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,580
all the kind of changes
and everything.

236
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,670
So I'm hoping Mike's happy.

237
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,900
This is a big shout out
to him, as well.

238
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,410
Because it's actually
a big change.

239
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,920
There's a lot of things that you
might have to, well, you

240
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,256
don't have to worry too much
about web audio at the moment.

241
00:11:06,256 --> 00:11:08,670
But you might be caught-- there
might be situations

242
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,160
where you would want to
know that the user's

243
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,090
background of your page.

244
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,185
So you need to still be
respectful of the user if

245
00:11:13,185 --> 00:11:14,340
you're playing audio on.

246
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,290
You might have to deal
with that, still.

247
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,720
Actually, you probably should
deal with that.

248
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,900
Just be respectful.

249
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,830
But then, you've got this whole
class of applications

250
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,240
like podcast players.

251
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,510
And people watch the news on,
say, BBC News, and want to go

252
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,430
off and do other things.

253
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,295
And we can let that happen.

254
00:11:29,295 --> 00:11:32,930
I think the interesting thing
to know is in theory, what

255
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:36,700
should happen is if another
action interrupts this,

256
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,930
whether a user gets a phone--

257
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,150
say a user, you know, a person--
they get the phone

258
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,160
call while this is happening.

259
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,410
The music stops playing, and
the audio stops playing.

260
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,450
And I don't believe
it resumes.

261
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:47,550
So it's just stopped.

262
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,560
But that's cool.

263
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,660
That's way more further than
we've been in the past.

264
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,110
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, absolutely.

265
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,330
Cool.

266
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,850
So the next one is CSS Calc.

267
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:57,660
And I'll bring this one up.

268
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,900
And Paul, do you want to talk
a little bit about this one?

269
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,600
So I'll open the page.

270
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,180
And we've got this guy
showing right now.

271
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,230
PAUL KINLAN: I'm hoping it's
the correct version.

272
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,330
Because I found a bug just
before we started.

273
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,600
PETE LEPAGE: It's version two.

274
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,360
PAUL KINLAN: Then we
should be good.

275
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,900
But basically, what CSS Calc is
is this ability to perform

276
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,630
basic calculations inside CSS.

277
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:21,030
So for instance, you
could say well, my

278
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,280
width is normally 50%.

279
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,725
But I want it to be an
extra 10 pixels.

280
00:12:24,725 --> 00:12:28,080
Well, you could never really
do that in CSS at the time.

281
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,730
You couldn't combine
calculations together.

282
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:31,790
Well, you can now.

283
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,750
And it's been in Chrome
25 for a while.

284
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:39,050
I believe in M 26, at least at
the moment, it's on prefix.

285
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,250
But right now, on the Android
browser, which was the bug I

286
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,840
found earlier on, it's prefixed
with hyphen calc.

287
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,700
The rest of the

288
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,430
functionality's exactly the same.

289
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,270
But it lets you do those little
things like, I want to

290
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,160
add 30 pixels to two EMs.

291
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,520
I want to do 50% minus 55%.

292
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,160
You can even do those types
of things to keep

293
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,410
the units the same.

294
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,015
It just gives you a lot more
flexibility when you're

295
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:02,980
designing your layouts.

296
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,670
And it's actually there now
inside everyone's latest

297
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,657
stable Chrome.

298
00:13:06,657 --> 00:13:08,490
So that's pretty good.

299
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,770
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

300
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:12,830
The coolest thing to me about
this is being able to go and

301
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:18,670
use different values or
different formats.

302
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,390
It's just always been one of
those things where you're

303
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,750
like, oh crap, I
did it in this.

304
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,810
And now I need to do--

305
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,910
and now you can do this
much more easily.

306
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:32,340
So bringing Chrome for Android
really closer to parity with

307
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:37,650
desktop is a really big
theme of this launch.

308
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,680
One of the next ones is support
for shadow DOM.

309
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,130
So I'll bring up
this demo here.

310
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,910
And I think this one's
kind of cool.

311
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,180
And we'll take a look
at the source for

312
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,450
this in a couple minutes.

313
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,990
But Paul, do you want to just
sort of explain again what's

314
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,800
going on on this one?

315
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,240
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

316
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,125
So I find it awkward to explain

317
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,330
the shadow DOM sometimes.

318
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,272
But in this demo, at least,
anyway, it's a picture of a

319
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:01,840
badge that says,
my name is Bob.

320
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,860
And when you look at the HTML,
you'll probably see the fact

321
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,890
that you'll just see this
element, which is just the

322
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,430
basic element.

323
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,810
There's basically a div inside
there which says, Bob.

324
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,410
It doesn't say anything else.

325
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,460
It just says, Bob.

326
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,960
But we've got this big rendering
on the outside of

327
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,610
the badge, and some
other text, and a

328
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:18,470
lot of other things.

329
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:21,380
And essentially, what's been
enabled in M 25 is the ability

330
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,530
to create a shadow root.

331
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:26,340
And the shadow root is this
entry point into this DOM that

332
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,050
you never see as a web developer
when you look at the

333
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:29,620
view source.

334
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,090
You have to enable shadow DOM
inspection inside the

335
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,780
developer tools.

336
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,360
But you don't actually see it.

337
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,820
And the idea is that, well,
you might have these third

338
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,800
party controls or these extra
controls for your user

339
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,120
interface elements.

340
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,370
And all you really want to see
in your HTML is the fact that

341
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,310
you know that you've got
that thing in there.

342
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,670
And that's what it's
basically doing.

343
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,690
It's created via some JavaScript
at the moment.

344
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:54,390
So you get a reference to the
element that you want to

345
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,250
enhance, say to create
a shadow root.

346
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,340
And that's it.

347
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,210
You basically can start
re-projecting the content from

348
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:04,690
the shadow root onto the
actual main DOM itself.

349
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:07,340
It's pretty nebulous at the
moment, in my understanding,

350
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,710
and especially the demo.

351
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,590
You can't really see much.

352
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:12,035
I know when we show you the
code, hopefully it will become

353
00:15:12,035 --> 00:15:13,180
a lot clearer.

354
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,135
But it basically allows you
to make components.

355
00:15:15,135 --> 00:15:17,560
You've got the template tag in
there as well, which is kind

356
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,565
of interesting.

357
00:15:18,565 --> 00:15:20,810
But yeah, you can start to build
these nice components.

358
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:23,620
But the user face in HTML--

359
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,860
is that a way of saying it?--
is a lot simpler.

360
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,080
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

361
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,210
I think the thing that is really
going to be interesting

362
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:32,990
about this is that the ability
to be able to build

363
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,630
components.

364
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:39,570
So today, you can go to jQuery
UI, or you can use things like

365
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,360
Bootstrap, that kind of stuff.

366
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,780
And it gives you a set
of components.

367
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:47,370
But you usually have to wrap
HTML and HTML to get a bunch

368
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,660
of things to happen.

369
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,070
And it works, and it's
a perfectly good

370
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,200
way of doing things.

371
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,260
But wouldn't it be great to be
able to say, calendar control.

372
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,230
And it goes and puts the right
calendar in, and you can style

373
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,260
it all appropriately.

374
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,120
You get the things
that you want.

375
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,550
And that's where I think the
shadow DOM is really going to

376
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:09,090
become a really powerful
and interesting piece.

377
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:09,465
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

378
00:16:09,465 --> 00:16:12,910
Like I said, it's
a bit powerful.

379
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,780
You might not start to use
it for a little while.

380
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,350
But the fact is, it's consistent
across Chrome now.

381
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,250
And it's there across all
of our instances.

382
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,620
Not like our version of Chrome
that you get from all the

383
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,780
places that you normally get
them, whether it's the store,

384
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:27,720
or whether it's from the web or
the normal desktop version,

385
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,160
then you will have shadow
DOM enabled.

386
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,260
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

387
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,840
And this is something that's
coming to other

388
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,620
browsers, as well.

389
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,900
This is not just a
Chrome feature.

390
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,080
These are open web platform
features, right?

391
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,740
Yeah.

392
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,350
PAUL KINLAN: It's cool.

393
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,180
PETE LEPAGE: And that's
something, as well, that's

394
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:40,910
also pretty cool.

395
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,960
So yeah, right now,
it's just here.

396
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,720
But it's coming to
other browsers.

397
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,460
You'll be able to use this
in other places, as well.

398
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,410
Awesome, all right.

399
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,780
So let's get out of here.

400
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:55,450
So we'll close this guy,
and have a look

401
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:59,850
at the iUser timings.

402
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,810
Now, with desktop browsers,
we've been able to go and get

403
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:06,329
user timings for quite
some time.

404
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:09,060
And it's pretty powerful to be
able to understand how many

405
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,319
milliseconds it's taking for
your navigations to happen,

406
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,980
for your pages to load, so you
can really understand where

407
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,510
the bottlenecks are.

408
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,359
And now in Chrome for Android
in the latest

409
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,900
release, we have that.

410
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,349
So we can go and see, OK, well,
so in this particular

411
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:27,109
instance, our navigation
started at--

412
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:30,470
I'm not even going to try
and read that number.

413
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,450
It looks like we have
an undefined for

414
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,410
our navigation end.

415
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:37,610
So that may just be
a bug in the code.

416
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:38,910
PAUL KINLAN: There's
actually a few of

417
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,880
the standard elements.

418
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,510
Basically, when I built
the sample, I took

419
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,500
everything from the spec.

420
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,400
And then there's some across
different browsers which

421
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,160
aren't quite implemented, which

422
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,280
is why you get undefined.

423
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,270
But there's the whole load
of navigation stuff.

424
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,070
I think there's some DMS
ones in there, as well.

425
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,120
This is information
that you never get

426
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,130
outside of dev tools.

427
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,450
But you might want an instrument
inside your

428
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,410
application.

429
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:04,680
Like, I've not seen anyone do it
just yet, but I would like

430
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,080
to see people starting to pipe
their representation lists

431
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,710
into Google Analytics.

432
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,120
So that they can kind of start
to see different response

433
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,860
times, and how fast things
are, how that materially

434
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,595
affects the users,
essentially.

435
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:19,640
And that's what this
enables on desktop.

436
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,280
It's now on mobile.

437
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:21,640
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

438
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,530
And I think one of the other
things that, this is really

439
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:24,360
important on mobile.

440
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,460
Because mobile performance is
completely different in many

441
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,710
ways than desktop
web performance.

442
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:36,710
Because you're going over a 3G
or a 4G radio, or sometimes

443
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:42,440
even Edge or GPRS, your
performance's characteristics

444
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,240
are going to be significantly
different.

445
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,200
So to understand how you
can make sure that your

446
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,140
performance on your mobile
website and your mobile web

447
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,930
apps is optimized, this is a
really good tool for being

448
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:59,350
able to dig into those and
see what's going on.

449
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,140
All right.

450
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,540
So support for the
track element.

451
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,110
Let's go for that one.

452
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,880
This one I think is
kind of cool.

453
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,980
And if you're familiar with the
track element, the track

454
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:13,430
element allows you to
add captioning or

455
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,330
text tracks to videos.

456
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,700
So if you were watching this
video after the fact, and you

457
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,690
see the numbers of the text
that's showing up, it would

458
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,790
show up below.

459
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,310
So in this case, I'm going
to go hit play on

460
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,750
this particular video.

461
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,710
And we'll scroll down
here in a sec.

462
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:35,110
And you can see that below,
we've got the text is showing

463
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:37,890
up below the video.

464
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:41,820
And we also have the video
playing quite nicely, as well.

465
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:46,200
You can see the little CC
icon there, as well.

466
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,840
Paul, do you have anything you
want to add for this one?

467
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,330
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, actually,
this is kind of

468
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,010
interesting, this one.

469
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,860
This is a demo made by
Sam Dutton, one of my

470
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,270
colleagues in the UK.

471
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,470
And basically, he's
really into media.

472
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,380
And he's been all over
the track element for

473
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,510
quite a while now.

474
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:01,320
But the interesting thing about
this is there's actually

475
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,325
a book in what we know as Chrome
for Android 25, which

476
00:20:06,325 --> 00:20:07,450
is this version.

477
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,600
Where if you look at the video,
you'll probably see

478
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,020
black lines across the very
bottom of the video.

479
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,880
That's actually the text track
apparently where it's been

480
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,220
made a little bit too small.

481
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:19,990
So this is it.

482
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:23,600
So what happens is underneath,
where you actually see the

483
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,820
text, and it says--

484
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,720
I'm a little bit delayed, but
I can see it says under what

485
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,150
happens, if there was change,
and all that type of stuff.

486
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:32,050
That's actually triggered by the
events from the track API.

487
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:35,180
So the track API is firing
events when the new captions

488
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,370
should come in, and all
this type of stuff.

489
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,480
And then Sam is basically
looking at what that DOM

490
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:45,010
element is, re-projecting it
onto the page as the timing

491
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,000
changes, basically.

492
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,440
So it's a little
bit of a hack.

493
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,335
But the fact is that you get
this information out anyway,

494
00:20:50,335 --> 00:20:52,810
so you can go and do whatever
you want with the different

495
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,810
types of track information.

496
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,250
So it's pretty cool.

497
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,960
I expect that'll probably be
fixed at some point soon.

498
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,440
PETE LEPAGE: All right.

499
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,250
Well, I'm going to switch
out the phone,

500
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,490
and plug in my laptop.

501
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,540
Paul, do you want to talk about
some of the changes to

502
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,160
the viewport so that I
can set up and show

503
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,910
some of the dev tools?

504
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,160
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

505
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,640

506
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,055
So the viewport, it's never
that [INAUDIBLE].

507
00:21:16,055 --> 00:21:18,838
But there's been some changes,
essentially with the way that

508
00:21:18,838 --> 00:21:23,550
we handle viewport in the last
couple of weeks, at least.

509
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,010
And the change is the difference
between the old

510
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:30,600
Android browser and then the
Chrome browser on Android.

511
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,340
And basically, there's an
attribute when you're actually

512
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:38,470
setting up your viewport where
you set user scale.

513
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:42,810
Like min scale, max scale, the
width of the viewport, whether

514
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:45,290
it matches the device script,
or it's something else.

515
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,355
And then there's one extra
tag which is I

516
00:21:47,355 --> 00:21:48,780
think target density.

517
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,830
And you can basically say target
density equals device

518
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:54,590
density DPI, or something
similar to that.

519
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:57,340
We've detected quite a few sites
that actually exist out

520
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,780
there with this set.

521
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,940
It doesn't do anything
anymore.

522
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,970
It's been removed.

523
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:03,080
Basically, no other browser
supports it anymore.

524
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:07,350
Because we have better ways of
actually detecting the users',

525
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:10,050
essentially the users' DPI,
which you can do via

526
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:12,540
JavaScript and CSS itself,
[INAUDIBLE]

527
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,330
in a media inquiry.

528
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,410
So it's been removed.

529
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,380
If you've got it, you
can remove it.

530
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:17,990
It's safe to remove it.

531
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:20,620
Don't worry about it so much.

532
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,984
And that's pretty much it.

533
00:22:22,984 --> 00:22:24,234
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

534
00:22:24,234 --> 00:22:26,030

535
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:26,720
That's a big one.

536
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,850
There's a blog post that we just
put up, recommending that

537
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,170
people stop using that.

538
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:35,200
If you haven't gone and tested
your site, you should go and

539
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,150
just do a quick run through
of your site.

540
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:41,010
Just to make sure that it is
working as you expect it to

541
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:44,030
work in this new way.

542
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:49,070
Because we found a few
particular sites where it just

543
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:52,470
doesn't work as expected.

544
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:55,020
PAUL KINLAN: Did we do content
security policy?

545
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:59,100
PETE LEPAGE: We didn't talk
about content security policy.

546
00:22:59,100 --> 00:22:59,860
Go for it.

547
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,150
PAUL KINLAN: Do we got a couple
of seconds to do that?

548
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,000
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

549
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,430
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, OK.

550
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:06,115
So content security policy is
enabled in M 25 in Chrome,

551
00:23:06,115 --> 00:23:09,820
which means enabled in M 25 for
Android Chrome, as well.

552
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,400
And basically, if you've ever
watched any of the Chrome apps

553
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,220
Hangouts that me and [INAUDIBLE]
do, you'll see us

554
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,960
talk about content security
policy all the time.

555
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,590
So you're probably OK
with this, right?

556
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:22,433
But for everyone else who
hasn't heard of content

557
00:23:22,433 --> 00:23:24,360
security policy, it basically--
it's a set of

558
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,050
directives that you can include
in your HTTP headers

559
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:30,950
on the response back that
indicate essentially what type

560
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,730
of domains that requests can
come from from the site.

561
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:36,570
It's essentially there to
mitigate cross site scripting.

562
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,960
So you can basically say,
I don't allow scripts--

563
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,700
I only want to allow scripts
from my domain.

564
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,600
I don't want to allow scripts
from any other site.

565
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,780
And I don't want
to allow eval.

566
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,140
I don't want to allow
new function.

567
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,260
I don't want to allow any
inline script, as well.

568
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,340
Because inline script's
an interesting one.

569
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,950
If someone can inject a script
tag into your page, well, they

570
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,490
can cross site script
your page.

571
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:57,570
And the idea behind content
security policy is you can

572
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,710
actually turn that
feature off.

573
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,760
So you can say, people can't--

574
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,970
basically, they might be able
to insert a script.

575
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:06,560
But they can't insert any old
piece of JavaScript that they

576
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,510
choose to execute themselves.

577
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,215
So you can do those types things
of things, as well.

578
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:11,190
And that's there.

579
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,060
It's available.

580
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,800
And if you want to speak to
Mike West, one of our

581
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:20,390
colleagues based in Germany, in
Munich, he would be telling

582
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,830
you to turn it on now.

583
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,010
I think that's really
good advice.

584
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:25,730
He'd also tell you to
learn HTTPS, which

585
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,210
again, you should do.

586
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,520
But you combine these two pieces
of technology together,

587
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,700
and we start to get
more secure sites.

588
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,500
We mitigate a lot of risks by
having these things enabled.

589
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,260
But it requires browser support,
and it's in the

590
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:36,990
browser now.

591
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:37,500
PETE LEPAGE: Yep.

592
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,600
Yeah, that's a really
good point.

593
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,870
All right, well, I've got the
remote debugger set up.

594
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,170
So you should be able
to see that.

595
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,810
I also want to point
out, if we could

596
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,880
put the link to questions.

597
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,280
If you have questions as we're
going through, we'd love to

598
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,980
take your questions.

599
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,000
So you can post your questions
there on Moderator.

600
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,050
As soon as we finish up here on
some of the dev tool stuff,

601
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,350
we'll be popping
over to there.

602
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:03,570
So post your questions
to Google Moderator.

603
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:09,250
And I will go, and let's have
a quick peek at some of the

604
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,680
stuff that's available
on dev tools.

605
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,750
So first one I want to actually
have a look at is the

606
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,120
shadow DOM stuff.

607
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,700
I'm actually going to go and
we'll reload this page here,

608
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:24,050
so we can get the shadow
DOM test loaded.

609
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:27,950
And if have a look at the
elements here, if I can get

610
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,160
this guy to load.

611
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,415
Uh oh.

612
00:25:30,415 --> 00:25:36,460
I always love when the demo gods
go not so happy on you on

613
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,180
fun little demos.

614
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,820
Let's see if we can
get this going.

615
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,920
Do, do, do, do, do.

616
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,490
I had this working
earlier today.

617
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:43,880
It did work, trust me.

618
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,720

619
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,030
All right.

620
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,930
Well, let me do this.

621
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,180
Let me try restarting Chrome.

622
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,090

623
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,655
PAUL KINLAN: I think to explain
problem for everyone

624
00:25:54,655 --> 00:25:58,250
who's not used dev tools,
basically the dev tools that

625
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,795
you see inside normal Chrome
that you connect to your web

626
00:26:01,795 --> 00:26:05,140
page to inspect, we have that
available in Android.

627
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,170
And the way that you do it is
that you have to use the

628
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,090
Android FDK to download ADB.

629
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:11,470
And we kind of know that's
a bit of a problem.

630
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:14,860
But you have to use this tool,
ADB, which lets you forward

631
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:18,080
requests from your machine
to your USB

632
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,740
connected Android device.

633
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,250
And then once you do that,
and you can actually

634
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,200
then use the dev tools.

635
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,170
Because dev tools, if you don't
remember, this is on

636
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:26,640
Android, it's pretty much the
same version of Chrome.

637
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,770
So it has the same kind of dev
tools experiments, same type

638
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,640
of kit and everything
inside dev tools.

639
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,010
You connect to that, and then
you get that whole ability

640
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:37,010
from the client, which is your
main machine's connected to

641
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:39,620
your mobile phone with
the dev tools.

642
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:42,740
And because they're the same,
the dev tools are actually

643
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:46,390
served up by the phone, and not
necessarily Chrome itself,

644
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:47,750
you get all the latest
improvements.

645
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:50,580
So if you're on M 18, which is
the last version for Android,

646
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,100
you'd have the M 18 dev tools.

647
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,140
Been a lot of improvements in
between, including a lot of

648
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,470
profiling changes.

649
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:59,930
So you'll basically see
these come up now.

650
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:02,200
And you've got the ability to
connect, use the dev tools

651
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,370
that's on the machine.

652
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:04,910
And you get a lot of goodness
out of it, including

653
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:07,410
performance profile,
DOM inspection, all

654
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,880
that type of magic.

655
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,130
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

656
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,830

657
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,390
A reload helped.

658
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:18,290
So if we have a quick peek at
the one where we were talking

659
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:21,960
about the shadow DOM, you can
see I've got this template ID

660
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,450
equals name tag template.

661
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:28,450
And if I expand this out, I've
got all of the details that

662
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:28,980
are in there.

663
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,370
Now, I think in my particular
case, I'm going to bring up

664
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:36,700
the settings, so that I can see
what's in my particular

665
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,630
settings, I've got the show
shadow DOM turned on.

666
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:44,150
Let me turn that off,
and reload this page

667
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:46,761
so that we can see--

668
00:27:46,761 --> 00:27:47,790
oh, it's still there.

669
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,470
All right, never mind.

670
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:53,660
So with that, you can go in and
be able to dig into the

671
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,500
shadow DOM.

672
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,830
You can be able to go and
see the different

673
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,400
elements that are there.

674
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,370
You can see all of the
other additional

675
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,800
settings that are available.

676
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,650
So if we have a look at some
of the new stuff that's

677
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:09,580
available within the settings,
there's now the show shadow

678
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:12,640
DOM, so that we can go in and
see what's going on there.

679
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,250
There's also these two
rendering, show paint

680
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,790
rectangles and show FPS meter.

681
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:21,970
So if I turn on the show FPS
meter, we all of a sudden get

682
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:24,400
the ability to see the number
of frames per second that's

683
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,390
being rendered on my device.

684
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:30,280
So I can see that right now,
this is rendering at about 60

685
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,790
frames per second.

686
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,410
Not like there's a whole heck
of a lot happening.

687
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:34,610
So not a big deal.

688
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:37,080
And we can also turn on
the paint rectangles.

689
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,080
So as we go through and try
and change things on this

690
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,170
particular page, we
can see where

691
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,210
things are getting painted.

692
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:46,650
Now, this is not exactly the
best example of this.

693
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:49,440
Because there's not a lot
on this particular page.

694
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,470
But you get the idea that you
can see as things are getting

695
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:58,310
repainted, where that painting
is truly happening.

696
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,810
The ability for source maps is
in there, just as you would

697
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:04,260
expect, as is on the desktop.

698
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:08,720
As well, we can show the CPU
activity on the ruler.

699
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,760
If I pop over to some of the
overrides, let me make this a

700
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,440
little bit bigger so we can see
it, you can override the

701
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,200
user agent.

702
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,830
So if you want to fake out
Chrome for Android and make

703
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:22,180
the website think that it's
running something else, maybe

704
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,490
you want to see how a website
is serving different content

705
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:30,390
for an iOS device versus a
Chrome device, you can go in,

706
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,730
and you can change that.

707
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,900
You can also--

708
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,000
go ahead.

709
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,130
PAUL KINLAN: I was going
to say, you just hit

710
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:35,720
the nail on the head.

711
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,010
It's like, we've been doing a
lot of work with trying to see

712
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,000
which sites do what.

713
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,890
And there are still sites that
try, basically, they'll

714
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:44,450
specialize for iOS or specialize
for Android.

715
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,145
Because they think iOS
has got a feature.

716
00:29:46,145 --> 00:29:49,770
And then they'll override a
feature that is already

717
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,410
implemented in Chrome for
Android, essentially.

718
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:54,415
And if you change the user
agent, you can kind of test to

719
00:29:54,415 --> 00:29:57,300
see whether the iPhone version
essentially works better.

720
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,920
Then you'll kind of know
whether they do

721
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,070
that type of thing.

722
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,080
It's nice.

723
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,210
PETE LEPAGE: In fact, this
is a really good example.

724
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,480
One of the things that we found
when we were looking at

725
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,390
the viewport settings was that
a lot of sites who were using

726
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:14,710
the device density DPI attribute
in their viewport,

727
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:18,790
they would use it only on
Chrome or on Android.

728
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:21,670
But they wouldn't send
it to iOS devices.

729
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:24,290
So one of the ways that I was
able to test and figure out

730
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:27,580
oh, hang on, what's the best fix
for some of these sites?

731
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:31,310
Was by going and changing the
user agent to iOS and being

732
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,100
like hey, just give us this.

733
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,920
It works perfectly.

734
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:39,300
And that was a really
easy fix for them.

735
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,400
You can also go in and override
your geolocation

736
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,210
settings, the device
orientation.

737
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:49,050
Emulate touch events, that one's
kind of one of those

738
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:52,740
things that's in there because
it's available on the desktop.

739
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:56,160
And you don't really need to
emulate them on the mobile

740
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,160
device, but it's there anyway.

741
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:03,628
And you can also emulate some
of the CSS properties.

742
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:05,470
PAUL KINLAN: That's cool.

743
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,790
I really like dev tools.

744
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:09,280
I'm hoping that we
get [INAUDIBLE]

745
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,740
mobile specific dev
tools session.

746
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,090
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

747
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:14,060
I think that's a really
valuable thing.

748
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,350
And we'll try and get them on
within the next couple weeks.

749
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,720
Because there's a lot of new
stuff available, and I think a

750
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,350
lot of really interesting and
powerful things available for

751
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:25,610
us as developers.

752
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:28,170
So that's sort of the end of
the stuff that I wanted to

753
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:30,450
show really quickly
in the dev tools.

754
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:32,140
Paul, was there anything
else that you think

755
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,867
is worthy of a highlight?

756
00:31:34,867 --> 00:31:37,640
PAUL KINLAN: Dev
tools wise, or?

757
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,250
PETE LEPAGE: Dev tools, or
actually anything else,

758
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,400
because I think at this point,
we've covered most of the

759
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,660
stuff that we wanted to.

760
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,600
PAUL KINLAN: I think there's a
lot of stuff under the hood

761
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,880
just infiltrating.

762
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,410
[INAUDIBLE] compositor,
it's a big change.

763
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:53,280
Basically, you'll see the
difference when you scroll

764
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,170
through any site.

765
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:57,110
Because you'll see the
content still.

766
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:59,780
So at the same time, we want a
lot of feedback about your

767
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:03,140
experiences with the
developer tools, or

768
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,120
with the latest version.

769
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,070
Especially if you're a
developer, and you found

770
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:08,960
something that doesn't work
quite as you'd expect.

771
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,210
[INAUDIBLE].

772
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:14,990

773
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:18,170
So yeah, send us all the
reports you want.

774
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,490
Also, send us feedback
on what you want to

775
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,330
hear about, as well.

776
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:23,710
Because we have some ideas,
but obviously, we want you

777
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:26,000
guys to learn things from what
we're talking about.

778
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,630
And we're not going to
do a what's new in

779
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:31,830
Android every week.

780
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:34,290
PETE LEPAGE: We don't ship
every week, yeah.

781
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:34,910
PAUL KINLAN: Exactly right.

782
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:38,190
But at the same time, there's
going to be a

783
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,140
lot of stuff coming.

784
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,526
And we're going to have a whole
lot of new features to

785
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:43,095
talk to you about.

786
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:44,900
PETE LEPAGE: So that's
a really great point.

787
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,530
With Chrome for Android, you can
run Chrome Beta and Chrome

788
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,660
Stable side by side.

789
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,920
You can't do that
on the desktop.

790
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,860
And so if you want to see what's
coming, you want to

791
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,490
play with some of those things,
that's a really great

792
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:58,900
way to see what's coming,
and just sort

793
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:02,666
of see what's exciting.

794
00:33:02,666 --> 00:33:05,530
PAUL KINLAN: Actually, one thing
I did want to talk about

795
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:09,460
is that I think in this one,
you can use about flags.

796
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:12,960
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, that, yes!

797
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,080
PAUL KINLAN: You've got the
ability now in stable Chrome

798
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,080
to be able to toggle all
of these settings.

799
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,460
One, especially if you're a
games developer and you want

800
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:23,790
to do WebGL on mobile, and
pretty much Firefox is the

801
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:27,650
only option, you could enable
that and test it inside your

802
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:28,160
browser now.

803
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,440
It's not available on
the general web.

804
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,670
It has to be enabled
by a Chrome flags.

805
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:34,560
But things like WebGL,
especially, these are the

806
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,062
technologies which we want to
get out there, but we don't

807
00:33:37,062 --> 00:33:39,400
think are quite ready
just yet.

808
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,402
We'd love feedback on all these
other features, as well.

809
00:33:42,402 --> 00:33:45,870
Or you've got uses for
them, at least.

810
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:49,280
Chrome flags, interestingly,
all the normal Chrome colon

811
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,990
slash slash URLs would work.

812
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:55,180
So if you want to go and check
what appcache is doing, Chrome

813
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:59,870
colon slash slash appcache
internals, those types of

814
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:02,102
things, you get the full
accessible of what you need on

815
00:34:02,102 --> 00:34:03,274
the device.

816
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:06,150
And you don't have to enable
developer [INAUDIBLE].

817
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,930
PETE LEPAGE: That's
pretty slick.

818
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:08,300
Cool.

819
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,820
Well, why don't we switch
over and take

820
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:13,100
some of your questions.

821
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,170
I'm going to bring this up.

822
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:18,230
And if you guys have questions
that you want to post, please

823
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,199
feel free to post those
to the Moderator.

824
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:22,159
We'll put the link up there.

825
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,820
And let me load questions.

826
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:28,150
Maybe it's slow internet
day here at Google.

827
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,670
PAUL KINLAN: I've got the
questions, if you want.

828
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,530
PETE LEPAGE: OK yeah, why
don't we just switch

829
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:32,330
to the two of us.

830
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,130
And you can go for questions,
and we can

831
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:34,940
take them from there.

832
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,710
PAUL KINLAN: We've got
two questions.

833
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:39,734
The first one is, any plans to
make available camera capture

834
00:34:39,734 --> 00:34:45,105
via getUserMedia and WebRTC
in Chrome for Android?

835
00:34:45,105 --> 00:34:46,020
Pete?

836
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,110
PETE LEPAGE: Sure, absolutely.

837
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:50,219
I want to answer this question
a little bit more generally.

838
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:52,469
Because I think it's a little
bit more fun to do that.

839
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:55,820
And it gives you a little
bit more excitement

840
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,320
about what's coming.

841
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:03,220
The plan is to really get
desktop and phone parity.

842
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,730
So we want to make sure that
the same features that are

843
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:09,420
available for Chrome for
desktop are available.

844
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,960
Now, it may take
a little while.

845
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,820
And some of these things, you
may see behind flags.

846
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,280
But we do plan to get everything
as close to feature

847
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,600
parity as possible.

848
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,470
In fact, that's one you
can check out today.

849
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,750
If you go into Chrome
colon [INAUDIBLE]

850
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:32,100
flags, you can turn WebGL on in
Chrome M 25, which you can

851
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,100
see, these are things that
are moving forward.

852
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,590
It is behind a flag right now,
so that we can make sure that

853
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,310
we get it right.

854
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:43,590
We can not have somebody go
do something, it's like

855
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:46,900
absolutely beautiful but kind
of slow, or has a bad

856
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,410
experience.

857
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:51,390
We want to make sure that we
provide that great experience.

858
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,030
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

859
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:55,900
Parity's our thing.

860
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,070
We're not saying that we're
completely there just yet.

861
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,770
But we've come a long,
long way in a

862
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:01,550
relatively short time.

863
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,920
So I'm hopeful.

864
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,770
The interesting thing, if you
want to access the camera,

865
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:07,970
there's always the import
type you [INAUDIBLE]

866
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:10,390
accepts camera, or accepts
image type.

867
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:13,650
And then capture camera
and capture camcorder.

868
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:16,290
It'll let you do
video, as well.

869
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:17,580
So you do have access to them.

870
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,810
And they're still in there.

871
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,200
It's not as nice, obviously.

872
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:21,930
It's not as sexy.

873
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,320
It's not as inline
as you expect.

874
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:28,020
Everyone wants that Instagram
experience.

875
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:31,770
I mean, we do have a basic
solution in lieu of that.

876
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:33,390
Watch the space for all
the other features.

877
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:36,640
We want parity.

878
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,570
Second question is
about extensions.

879
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:39,795
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, yeah.

880
00:36:39,795 --> 00:36:43,040
PAUL KINLAN: Are we bringing
extensions anytime soon?

881
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,860
PETE LEPAGE: I don't think we
have anything to announce at

882
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,080
this point.

883
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,470
I know it's something that we're
certainly interested in.

884
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:53,060
The biggest concern that I
have around extensions is

885
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:57,040
really around performance and
accessibility on stuff.

886
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,180
On a desktop where you can have
all sorts of little icons

887
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:06,710
next to your address bar, where
you can take a little

888
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,780
bit of a performance hit,
because you're doing some

889
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,700
JavaScript processing.

890
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,620
Or maybe you're going and
pulling some additional

891
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:14,020
resources, and putting
them on a page.

892
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:18,060
That's OK, because you've
got a powerful computer.

893
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:21,390
On a phone or tablet, you
don't have that much

894
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:22,220
processing power.

895
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:26,470
So I think it's really important
that when we do

896
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:28,950
tackle this, we make sure
we tackle it right.

897
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:31,770
And we don't end up doing
anything that's going to cause

898
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:33,740
performance implications
for users.

899
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:37,220

900
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:37,960
Cool.

901
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,540
PAUL KINLAN: That's it.

902
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,280
I think that's all
the questions.

903
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,500
There's none on YouTube.

904
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,680
PETE LEPAGE: All right.

905
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,000
PAUL KINLAN: So yeah,
I think we're--

906
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,970
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

907
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:46,820
I want to say thanks everybody
for joining us.

908
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:50,330
Thanks, Paul, for joining
us from London.

909
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:52,250
We're going to be doing
this every Thursday.

910
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:55,250
So we'll be back next Thursday
at the same time.

911
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,970
And hope to see you then.

912
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:59,220
Thanks, everybody.

913
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:10,020
