00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,770

00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:02,490
JONAH JONES: Hi everyone.

3
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,480
Thanks for coming.

4
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,300
Today, Yatin and I are going to
give you guys a little talk

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,160
about the process we went
through when we were

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,570
redesigning the new Google Maps,
as I'm sure you saw in

7
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,970
the keynote on Wednesday.

8
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,960
Hope you guys are
enjoying this.

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,440
So, my name's Jonah.

10
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,200
I'm lead designer on the
new Google Maps.

11
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:20,690
YATIN CHAWATHE: And I'm Yatin.

12
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,620
I'm the engineering director.

13
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,030
I led the team that built
the new Google Maps.

14
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,550

15
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,470
JONAH JONES: So, as we were
going through this process of

16
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,220
doing this redesign from
the ground up--

17
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,090
as Bernie and I mentioned when
we were on the stage on

18
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:35,950
Wednesday--

19
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,810
there were three main concepts,
and we're going to

20
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,960
do a deep dive on two
of them today.

21
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,770
Now, one of them was that we can
build a new map with every

22
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,250
click, and there are some quite
interesting, difficult

23
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,600
problems that we had to solve
in order to do that.

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,860
And another one is that we
wanted to make sure that all

25
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,450
of the imagery we have in the
world is very easy to discover

26
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,890
and fun and immersive as well.

27
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,940
So we're going to go
through those two.

28
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,420
So, on the first one, let's talk
about how we build a map

29
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,920
for every place.

30
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,340
Now, one of the most important
things in building this map

31
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,449
for every place is highlighting
and making sure

32
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:07,020
that we're labeling
the right roads.

33
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,270
And this is actually
quite a challenging

34
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,570
thing to get right.

35
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,130
So I'll tell you a little
story first.

36
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,150
Which is that--

37
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,350
I like to travel a lot.

38
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,490
And I think it's amazing that
we've got these digital maps

39
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:22,210
nowadays, and we can carry these
around in our pocket.

40
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,930
And we can look at them on our
computers and everything.

41
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,660
But there's something missing a
little bit from the old days

42
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,840
of having an analog map.

43
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,240
So, this is an example of a map
that was drawn for me when

44
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,820
I first moved to Sydney
a few years ago.

45
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,375
And you probably remember when
you were traveling when you

46
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,655
were a little bit younger,
maybe you went

47
00:01:39,655 --> 00:01:41,220
and stayed in a hotel.

48
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,840
And the hotel concierge
would draw you a map.

49
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,320
And he'd annotate on top
of the existing map.

50
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,350
So, maybe they'd highlight some
of the roads that you

51
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,720
need to use to get to places
that you're interested in.

52
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,650
They'd highlight
places for you.

53
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,480
And this map is great, because
it was a map that has been

54
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,640
drawn for you and is
unique to you.

55
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,670
And it also is quite nice that
it serves as a form of

56
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,810
nostalgia afterwards.

57
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,250
So after your trip is done, you
can take this out one year

58
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,750
later and look back on it.

59
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,940
And we were wondering how we
can build a map that feels

60
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:15,190
customized to you, but
also fit for purpose.

61
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:20,590
So, if we look at how Google
Maps looks today, you can see

62
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,690
that this is a fairly
reasonable,

63
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,100
plain map of this area.

64
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,770
This is actually close to
my house in London.

65
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,160
And if we wanted to draw a map
of how to get to this park in

66
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,330
the middle here-- the
Pullens Gardens--

67
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,890
you could imagine that most
traditional maps would

68
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,060
probably just stick a pin
inside the map and

69
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,390
be done with it.

70
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,710
But that probably isn't the
best map that we could

71
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,160
possibly draw for this place.

72
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,250
For a start, the two cross
streets that you see right

73
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,960
next to the Pullens Gardens--

74
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,030
they're not even labeled.

75
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,210
And that's perfectly
reasonable.

76
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,070
These are very small streets,
and in the general scheme of

77
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,220
things, these are not the most
important roads to label here.

78
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,480
But in the context of the
Pullens Gardens, these are

79
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,590
super important.

80
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,780
And you can also see that
generally, there's just a lot

81
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,590
of information.

82
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,230
So even if we were labelling
those streets, no attention

83
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,750
would be drawn to those streets
as being particularly

84
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,280
important amongst all
of the other streets

85
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,325
that we've got nearby.

86
00:03:14,325 --> 00:03:17,540
Now if we were to take
a different approach.

87
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,470
My wife actually just drew
this map on a napkin.

88
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,420
And you can see here that this
is a vastly simplified

89
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,060
representation of how to get to
the Pullens Gardens in the

90
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,670
middle here.

91
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,710
Now this might be a little bit
hard for you to read her

92
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,340
handwriting, so let
me simplify this a

93
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,540
little bit for you here.

94
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,220
This is my diagrammatic
representation of the

95
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,890
information that we're
showing on the

96
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,880
Pullens Gardens map here.

97
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,820
Now we've got several things
we've left out and several

98
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,660
things we've left in here.

99
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:51,800
So, the first is the
major highways--

100
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,500
the major thoroughfares of the
city I left in, because these

101
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,400
roads are going to always
be important.

102
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,780
Because they're context and part
of the overall structure

103
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,710
of the city.

104
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:06,180
But the other thing we did was
we drew Penton Place, Amelia

105
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,220
Street, Crampton Street,
Illife Yard--

106
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,160
all of these more minor streets
that you need to take

107
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,000
to get to the Pullens Gardens
from the major streets--

108
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,480
we made sure that those
were highlighted

109
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,300
and labeled as well.

110
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,380
And of course, we also drew--

111
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,220
there's only one point of
interest that's really

112
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,170
important for this one, which
is Kennington station.

113
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,920
This is the local subway
station that

114
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,960
you'd need to get there.

115
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,030
But you could imagine that if
there's other major landmarks

116
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,020
nearby, perhaps where you're
going to be turning off the

117
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,620
streets, they would
be an important

118
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,800
thing to show as well.

119
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,960
So again, here's the map
that we had before.

120
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,060
And now here's the map that we
draw in the new Google Maps.

121
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,570
Now, this isn't quite such a
startlingly different change

122
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,600
as you might first think.

123
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,360
Because you might think, Oh, why
didn't they just draw the

124
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,700
equivalent of this napkin map?

125
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,540
But actually, that's not exactly
what we want in a new,

126
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,610
modern, interactive map, because
maybe you missed your

127
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,700
turning, and you still need to
be able to know what the other

128
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,610
roads are nearby for context.

129
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,500
Or maybe you're going to
drag the map away, or

130
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,680
zoom in, or zoom out.

131
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,080
So we still need a map that's
going to be useful in the

132
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,920
general case, but we're going
to subtly highlight all of

133
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,480
these roads that are important
and make sure

134
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,200
they're labeled as well.

135
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,860
So I'm going to hand you over to
Yatin to explain how we did

136
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,950
this process of selecting
the right roads.

137
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,630
Because although it might be
quite easy for one person to

138
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,360
draw a local road for their
local area, you can imagine

139
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,630
that it's quite challenging to
do this for absolutely any

140
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,660
place in the world.

141
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,490
So I'll hand you over.

142
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,130
YATIN CHAWATHE: Thank
you, Jonah.

143
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,940
So, how do we go
from this map--

144
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,730
which is a very simple base map
with a marker stuck on it

145
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,860
for Pullens Gardens.

146
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,760
This is what you normally see
in the classic Google Maps.

147
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,900
How do you go from here to the
map that Jonah just showed

148
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,680
moments ago?

149
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,890
Well, for starters, Google has
access to a significant amount

150
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:01,010
of anonymized information
about how our users--

151
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,880
our millions upon millions
of users--

152
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,540
use Google Maps every
single day.

153
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:11,040
We can analyze all of this
information and use that to

154
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,760
extract signals that allow us
to figure out which roads to

155
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,910
highlight on this map, for
this particular location.

156
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:22,560
And we can do that over and over
again, every time a user

157
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,501
looks at a map.

158
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:27,190
So let's look a little
bit more.

159
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:31,350
What information can we use in
order to figure out which

160
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,000
roads are important for
Pullens Gardens?

161
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,410
What I've shown here is every
single Driving Directions that

162
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:43,710
any user in Google has ever made
to the general vicinity

163
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,130
of Pullens Gardens.

164
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:49,140
So we look across all of our
driving directions that users

165
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:54,230
do millions of times every
single day, and figure out

166
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,170
which of those driving
directions are leading to the

167
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:00,490
general vicinity of Pullens
Gardens, and created a map

168
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,305
that looks somewhat like this.

169
00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:04,470
Now obviously, this
is a lot of data.

170
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:07,790
If I use this to highlight every
single road that this

171
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,500
map is showing in blue, that's
not really going to give me

172
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,800
any more compelling of a map
than what we had before.

173
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,530
So what do we do next?

174
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:22,000
Well, we can look at each one
of these driving directions

175
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,130
and start aggregating them to
figure out which little bit of

176
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,510
road segment--

177
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:31,060
how popular it is, and how many
of our users are going to

178
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,090
use it to get to Pullens
Gardens.

179
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:37,690
So you can, again, analyze all
of those Driving Directions

180
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,140
for every road segment that
leads from one intersection to

181
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,420
the next intersection.

182
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,370
You can figure out how many of
those Driving Directions would

183
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,880
have used that particular
segment

184
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,900
to get Pullens Gardens.

185
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,400
And once you do that, you can
rank all of the roads based on

186
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,070
the popularity that they have
for getting to the location

187
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,570
that you want to highlight.

188
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,290
And that's what this version
of the map is showing.

189
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:06,610
The deep blue roads are the ones
that were marked as more

190
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:09,730
important, more relevant for
getting to Pullens Gardens.

191
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:12,290
The light blue ones are all of
the other roads that we had in

192
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,070
the previous slide.

193
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,000
So you're now starting to
see a little bit of

194
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,150
structure to the map.

195
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,930
I'm just going to take away all
of the light blue so we

196
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,505
can see this a little
bit more clearly.

197
00:08:22,505 --> 00:08:26,410
At this zoom level, this now
starts to look like a

198
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:30,340
relatively clean and useful
map for Pullens Gardens.

199
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,010
It's starting to look very
similar to those napkin

200
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:36,559
sketches that Jonah was
showing earlier.

201
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,240
Let's zoom in a little bit more
and see what that looks

202
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,995
like at a closer zoom level.

203
00:08:40,995 --> 00:08:45,420
So here's what that same data
looks like as you zoom in to

204
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,490
be able to see the general
neighborhood

205
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,740
around Pullens Gardens.

206
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,240
And notice that those important
roads are still

207
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,530
highlighted.

208
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,150
The roads that actually lead
directly to Pullens Gardens

209
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,090
are also highlighted.

210
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:01,140
So Penton Place and Amelia
Street are marked

211
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,390
as important there.

212
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:06,610
But we're still missing some
other important context around

213
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:09,300
the immediate vicinity
of Pullens Gardens.

214
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,490
The cross streets that abut
either end of Pullens Gardens,

215
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:15,630
those are not pulled out yet.

216
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,210
So what the next step that the
algorithm does is it does a

217
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:23,215
very localized search around
the immediate vicinity of

218
00:09:23,215 --> 00:09:26,870
Pullens Gardens and starts to
look for signals that might be

219
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:31,320
relevant to highlight on the
map for Pullens Gardens.

220
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,430
And what that ends up pulling
out are these two smaller

221
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,430
roads that are not really that
relevant for our Driving

222
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:40,250
Directions or walking directions
from further away

223
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,220
coming down here, but they are
really relevant as contextual

224
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,330
information.

225
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,890
When I talk about Pullens
Gardens, I'm

226
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:46,990
going to say, oh, yeah.

227
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,320
It's on Amelia Street
between Illife Yard

228
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,710
and Crampton Street.

229
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:54,201
And that's what this ends up
allowing us to pull out.

230
00:09:54,201 --> 00:09:58,100
So you put all of this together
and you have the set

231
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,910
of roads that you might
want to highlight.

232
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,970
So now you have the base signals
that you want to use

233
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:08,060
to create the map that
Jonah showed earlier.

234
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,770
Again, as he mentioned, you
don't really want to just show

235
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:14,130
a map as desaturated as this.

236
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,820
You end up losing a lot of other
contextual information

237
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,450
that may be useful to some
users, even though it's not

238
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,920
the most useful information
for this place.

239
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,510
So how do you go about
doing that?

240
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:28,170
Let's start again with the base
map and just a marker.

241
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,500
That's all we have.

242
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,060
And now let's start pulling in
the signals that we captured

243
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,620
in the previous slide.

244
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,640
So the first step that the
algorithm does is it runs a

245
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,330
restyling filter on
this basemap.

246
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:43,640
For every single road that we
picked out as an important

247
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:48,010
road that we marked as blue in
that previous slide, we will

248
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:51,720
increase the intensity of the
color and the strokes

249
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,760
used for that road.

250
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,630
So I'm going to flip back and
forth between these a couple

251
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,830
of times so you can see
it more clearly.

252
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,960
Here is what the basemap
looks like.

253
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,790
Here's what the new
map looks like.

254
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,020
Basemap.

255
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,250
And new map.

256
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,790
And what you see is that the
roads that are important have

257
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,550
now become wider, and
the strokes have

258
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,470
become darker and stronger.

259
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,710
So they get pulled out a little
bit, but not so much as

260
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,130
to be in your face.

261
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,290
And the other thing you notice
is all the other roads get

262
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,240
dimmed out a little bit.

263
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,440
Those other roads are
not as relevant.

264
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,840
You don't want to take them off
the map, because somebody

265
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,870
else might care about them.

266
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,210
You want to leave them on the
map, but reduce their

267
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:33,030
intensity so that you can
actually pull out the roads

268
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,670
that matter.

269
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,650
So again, just one last time,
I'm going to show the previous

270
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:40,020
thing, and the new one.

271
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:40,970
So this is step one.

272
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,430
You restyle everything.

273
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:46,170
But notice that the streets that
we thought were really

274
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,650
relevant, like Crampton Street
and Amelia Street, are still

275
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,390
not labeled on the map.

276
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:54,750
So that's the next step that the
algorithm does is it runs

277
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:59,480
a relabeling pass in real time,
as you've just clicked

278
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,380
on this location, and
that gives you this.

279
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:07,200
So now, Amelia Street is
labeled, Crampton Street is

280
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,480
labeled, and we've made the
label for Pullens Gardens a

281
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,970
little bit bolder and stronger
because that is obviously the

282
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,660
most important label here.

283
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,260
Again, I'll flip back and
forth once or twice.

284
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,370
Here's what it looked like, and
here's what the new thing

285
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,160
looks like.

286
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,480
The other thing that the map
does is it takes away some of

287
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,110
the labels on the less
relevant streets.

288
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:30,250
So minor side streets that
might have been labeled

289
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,720
earlier because there was enough
space on the map to

290
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,970
label them, we'll take away
some of those labels.

291
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:38,100
Because those labels don't
matter nearly as much anymore.

292
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,900
But the labels of the streets
that are nearby that we've

293
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,780
identified as important
streets-- they're really

294
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:46,160
important, so we'll label
them more strongly.

295
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:52,440
So this, in a nutshell, is the
core set of algorithms that we

296
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:57,130
use to figure out how to create
a map that is truly

297
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,320
about Pullens Gardens.

298
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,520
And we take advantage of the
immense amount of computing

299
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,850
power that we have at our
disposal in Google's data

300
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:10,270
centers to be able to run this
algorithm every single second,

301
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,490
for every single user,
for every single

302
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,740
task that they perform.

303
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,990

304
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,420
The next thing we're going
to talk about--

305
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,820
I'm going to hand it back to
Jonah-- is to talk a little

306
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,930
bit more about how we explore
the world around us, around

307
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,490
Pullens Gardens or one of the
other places that you might

308
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:29,190
want to search on the map.

309
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,900
JONAH JONES: All right,
thanks Yatin.

310
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:36,580
So when I first joined Google,
I was living in London, and

311
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,590
then I went and joined
the Zurich office.

312
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:42,790
And so, I packed up my bags and
went and traveled there.

313
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,030
And I was living in
Zurich, and that

314
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,460
was all very exciting.

315
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,540
And every Christmas, I would
come back, and I

316
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,320
would visit my family.

317
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,210
And my grandma, at the time, she
was getting quite old, and

318
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,120
she wasn't really able
to travel anymore.

319
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,220
But she really wanted to
know what it was like

320
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,930
nearby where I lived.

321
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,560
And she'd never been to
Switzerland either.

322
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,510
So this is a picture
of Street View--

323
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:10,080
and this is my house
in Zurich--

324
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,990
and the amazing thing was from
our living room or our kitchen

325
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,410
in London, I was able to
go use Google Maps.

326
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,920
And we were able to fly to
street level and go and

327
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,960
explore the area around
where I lived.

328
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,980
And we called this going
for a drive.

329
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,120
And this was incredible,
because it gave her the

330
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,060
ability to travel to Switzerland
and actually see

331
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,350
this area where I lived.

332
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:39,850
Now, my grandma's no longer with
us, unfortunately, but if

333
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:43,200
I had the ability to fast
forward and show her what

334
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,460
we've done today, I think I'd
be really proud to show her

335
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:45,920
what we've done.

336
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,590
Because not only do we have this
immersive Street View, we

337
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,660
also have this incredible Earth
inside the browser,

338
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,370
which lets you feel as if you're
flying all over the

339
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,960
city in a helicopter.

340
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,910
And we also have these amazingly
immersive 3D tours.

341
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,670
And this is actually a photo
that I took of the

342
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,940
main river in Zurich.

343
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,920
And the 3D tools are a really,
really interesting part of

344
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,350
this, which have very difficult
engineering

345
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,230
challenges associated
with them.

346
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,860
And we wanted to make sure that
this wasn't a horrible,

347
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,220
overwhelming, enormous
slide show.

348
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,470
And we want to make sure that it
was also more immersive and

349
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:24,420
more engaging than just flipping
through one photo

350
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,380
after the other.

351
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,750
So we used a lot of techniques
from cinematography to make

352
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,190
sure that we picked the right
photos and transition nicely

353
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,680
between them.

354
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,730
And, again, as with that napkin
map, this might be a

355
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,570
fairly easy task for a human
to do if they were to do it

356
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:40,510
one by one by one.

357
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,860
But if you're going to generate,
using an algorithm,

358
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,305
a great 3D tool for thousands
and thousands of places for

359
00:15:46,305 --> 00:15:49,190
all over the world, this is
a pretty challenging task.

360
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,550
So I'm going to hand it back
to Yatin to explain how we

361
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,490
went about doing this.

362
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,480
YATIN CHAWATHE: Thanks, Jonah.

363
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,905
So, before I delve into the
technical details--

364
00:15:59,905 --> 00:16:04,590

365
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:08,340
before I go into the technical
details of how we build these

366
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:12,410
3D tours, let's take a
look at a 3D tour in

367
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,680
the new Google Maps.

368
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,470
What this is is a tour of the
Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris,

369
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:20,170
which is one of my favorite
cities in the world.

370
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,880
And it's showing you
many different

371
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,280
facades of the cathedral.

372
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,210
It shows you a lot of detail
work on some of the most

373
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:33,090
interesting aspects of the
cathedral, and then zooms out

374
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,410
and rotates around to
give you a final

375
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:36,700
other view of the cathedral.

376
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:43,710

377
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:47,370
So how did we go about building
this 3D tour and

378
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,620
other 3D tours like it?

379
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:54,790
Again, one of the big themes
around how we went about

380
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,070
building a lot of the
technologies behind the new

381
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:01,070
Google Maps is the immense
amount of information that

382
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,980
Google has access to.

383
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:08,180
So for 3D photo tours, the core
set of information that

384
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:12,140
we started to look at is the
thousands upon thousands of

385
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:17,300
photos that users like you and
I and Jonah have uploaded to

386
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,260
Google for public consumption
by everyone else.

387
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,180
So this might include photos
that you might have uploaded

388
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:27,640
to Google+ that you've
explicitly marked as shareable

389
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,500
with the entire world, photos
that users might have uploaded

390
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,710
to the Panoramio photo sharing
site, and any other similar

391
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:38,960
site within the Google
ecosystem.

392
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,120
So what this is showing you is
just a sliver of the tens of

393
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,320
thousands of photos
that we have of

394
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,220
the Notre Dame cathedral.

395
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,750
There's a whole bunch of these
photos, and what we want to

396
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:54,020
now do is figure out, how do you
take all of these photos

397
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:58,530
and go from them, and create a
single photo tour out of them.

398
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:02,290
So the first step of the
entire process involves

399
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:06,340
running a long series of
complex computer vision

400
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,640
algorithms that analyze this
entire collection of photos

401
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,670
for the Notre Dame, and try to
figure out exactly where that

402
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:18,210
photo was taken in the real
world, and where in the real

403
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:22,060
world every single pixel in
every one of these photos

404
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,610
corresponds to.

405
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:27,940
So for each pixel in every
photo, we know exactly which

406
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,900
other pixel in every other
photo that particular one

407
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,360
might correspond to.

408
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,170
And what that allows us to build
is a fairly detailed

409
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:41,750
three-dimensional model of
the Notre Dame cathedral.

410
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,260
And I'll show you what such
a model would look like.

411
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:49,290
So what you're seeing here is
what we call a 3D point cloud.

412
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:52,300
It's a whole bunch of dots
thrown into three-dimensional

413
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,570
space-- and then I've
just captured a

414
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,280
screen shot of that--

415
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:01,110
and what each of these dots
represents is one point across

416
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:04,920
the entire set of photos
that we identified.

417
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,760
Each of these points identifies
a point that was

418
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,220
matched in a set of pixels
across all of these photos.

419
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:16,190
And you can see, although the 3D
point cloud isn't complete,

420
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:20,050
you can clearly see that this
is a representation of the

421
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:22,170
Notre Dame Cathedral.

422
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:25,880
So what do we do once we have
this 3D point cloud?

423
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,200
The next step is, again,
as I said earlier--

424
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,520
we have on the order of tens of
thousands of photos of the

425
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,940
Notre Dame.

426
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,240
If I were to show you all of
those, that would look like a

427
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:42,000
tour of your poor cousin's trip
that he took, and you

428
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,330
don't want to really sit through
those 10,000 photos.

429
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:47,520
So what we really want to pull
out is a handful of photos

430
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,720
that really represent, that
bring out the essence of what

431
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,970
the Notre Dame looks like.

432
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:57,540

433
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:03,740
One thing we want to capture is,
what does the Notre Dame

434
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,370
look like in context?

435
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,730
What does it look like in the
surroundings where it's

436
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:09,820
physically located?

437
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,580
So that's one photo zoomed out
far enough where you can see

438
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,560
the entire cathedral.

439
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:20,790
You see it's right on the main
river that runs through Paris.

440
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:24,770
You want another one that really
brings out what the

441
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,050
cathedral is about.

442
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:32,130
So this is a front facade
photo of the cathedral.

443
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:35,340
Each of these photos that we're
picking, we also rank

444
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,740
them based on how popular
they are.

445
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,840
How many users have looked at
that photo, How many people

446
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,970
like that photo, and so on.

447
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:45,930
Here's the third photo.

448
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:51,850
This really gives you a
sense of detail that

449
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,080
represents the cathedral.

450
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,630
Again, this is the central arch
in the front facade of

451
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:58,460
the cathedral.

452
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:02,920
And what this is capturing is
one of the main aspects of the

453
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,410
cathedral that lots and
lots of users are

454
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,970
taking pictures of.

455
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,710
Another thing you might want
to capture is yet another

456
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,310
perspective on what the
cathedral looks like.

457
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:17,320
So you might want something that
captures a photo from the

458
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,450
right hand side and then yet
another one that shows you the

459
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:23,080
right hand side facade of the
cathedral, as we saw at the

460
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,050
end of the tour.

461
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:28,770
So this gives you somewhat of a
sense of what the cathedral

462
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:31,300
would look like from
various angles.

463
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:36,740
But that's not quite enough to
really give you an immersive

464
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:40,770
sense of what the cathedral
feels like if you

465
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:41,980
were to visit it.

466
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:45,550
So another thing we look for is
really picturesque photos

467
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,450
of the cathedral.

468
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,360
And there's a number of signals
that we can take into

469
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,150
account when identifying photos
that are considered

470
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,060
picturesque.

471
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:56,140
What this shows you is a very
beautiful nighttime view of

472
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:56,850
the cathedral.

473
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:00,170
The cathedral is beautifully lit
up and really gives you a

474
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:03,960
sense of a very different way
of looking at the cathedral.

475
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,310
What might be examples of photos
that you don't want to

476
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:10,800
choose for your photo tour?

477
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,440
Here's a couple.

478
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,810
Now, this photo on the left--

479
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:18,210
it's a really beautiful photo
of a bunch of flowers.

480
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,810
If you want to look at the
cathedral, it's not nearly as

481
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,900
representative of
the cathedral.

482
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,420
You can see bits and pieces of
the cathedral in the top left

483
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,810
corner, but they're
kind of blurry and

484
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:30,180
not really in focus--

485
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,720
it's not a very representative
photo.

486
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,050
And then that other photo
on the right.

487
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:38,400
It's a wonderful family enjoying
a great vacation in

488
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,970
Paris, not something that's
representative

489
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,890
to this entire audience.

490
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:46,020
So those are a few things that
we look for when we try to

491
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,400
figure out which photos may
not be good photos as

492
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,730
canonical photos.

493
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,890
So now we have all
of these photos.

494
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:56,830
What those green dots around the
3D point cloud are showing

495
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:01,100
is the specific camera position
where that photo was

496
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:01,900
taken from.

497
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,755
And this is, again, something we
can infer as we're building

498
00:23:04,755 --> 00:23:08,240
the 3D point cloud.

499
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,020
So now we have a set of photos,
and we know where

500
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,220
those photos were taken from.

501
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,100
What's the next step?

502
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,120
What Jonah mentioned earlier
when he was giving you a very

503
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,440
high level overview of these
photo tours is, we want to

504
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:27,340
take into account how
cinematographers have really

505
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:31,600
thought about how to navigate
through a scene, create a

506
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,790
camera motion model that really
reflects that and gives

507
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,610
you a very smooth, fluid motion

508
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,300
throughout the entire scene.

509
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,390
So we take all the canonical
photos and arrange them such

510
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:47,200
that you can create a path from
camera position to camera

511
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,840
position that feels very
fluid and natural.

512
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,450
And that's what this reflects.

513
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:55,470
We're going from the photo on
the bottom right all the way

514
00:23:55,470 --> 00:24:00,240
around in clockwise direction.

515
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,520
Let's take all of those and
arrange them in sequence now.

516
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,070
So that's what this
would look like.

517
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:09,060
So if you only took this
information and started to

518
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:14,490
create a 3D slide show out of
this, you would end up with a

519
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:16,610
lot of artifacts.

520
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:19,750
Going from the photo on the far
left to that next photo,

521
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,310
nighttime photo of the
cathedral, you're going to see

522
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:26,300
a lot of stretching if you try
to just warp one photo into

523
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,740
the next photo.

524
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:31,290
So what you want to do now is
identify a few interstitial

525
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:33,910
frames that you can use to
really create a smooth

526
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,690
transition effect.

527
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,840
Now, what you know here is the
set of photos that you really

528
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,090
want to linger the camera on.

529
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:43,150
And then you just want to
identify a few additional

530
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,360
photos that you can breeze
through without

531
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,780
spending a lot of time.

532
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:51,430
And you know the general camera
path that your tour is

533
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,650
going to take.

534
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:55,610
So what you can now do is go
back to your dataset of tens

535
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:58,580
of thousands of photos and start
looking for a few other

536
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:02,770
photos that match that
general camera path.

537
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,590
And that gives you something
like this.

538
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:08,140
Those red dots are the new
camera positions that we added

539
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,240
where we found a few
interstitial frames, and we

540
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,290
added those frames to this
entire sequence.

541
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:17,950
Now these interstitial frames,
they don't need to be terribly

542
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,040
high quality.

543
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,870
You can use fairly
low-resolution photos and

544
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:24,840
still be OK because they're
merely being used as filler

545
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,276
material as you're going from
one photo that you're going to

546
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:31,080
linger the camera on
to the next photo.

547
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,790
So you have a lot of flexibility
in being able to

548
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:36,110
identify photos that really give
you a very nice, smooth

549
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,680
transition.

550
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,850
You put all of this together,
and that ends up giving you a

551
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:44,210
3D tour of the Notre Dame.

552
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:47,580
We can do this not just for the
Notre Dame, but for any

553
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:51,090
other landmark around the world,
and we can do it not

554
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,370
just for landmarks.

555
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:59,330
So let's go back to the center
of Zurich where Jonah used to

556
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:03,250
live and see a photo tour
of the center of Zurich.

557
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:08,150
This is showing you a tour
around the Limmat River in the

558
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,240
center of Zurich.

559
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:14,010
And it gives you sort of a nice
360 degree view of the

560
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,356
heart of Zurich.

561
00:26:15,356 --> 00:26:21,340

562
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:25,070
So this was a very quick
overview, but I hope you were

563
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:29,470
able to get somewhat of a sense
of what the underlying

564
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:33,460
techniques are that go into
building these 3D photo tours.

565
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:37,750
So before I wrap up, I just want
to go back and summarize

566
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,430
the two main things
that we covered.

567
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:45,120
The first one was, how do you
build a map of a place every

568
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,270
single time, for every
single user?

569
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:52,550
We use a lot of information
that Google has access to

570
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:56,230
about how places are structured,
how people

571
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:59,930
navigate to get to those places,
to build these maps.

572
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:03,220
And the second is, once you
figure out how to get

573
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:06,320
somewhere, you want to really
get to know that place better.

574
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,090
And so we have a number of
different techniques that we

575
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:13,140
use to really give you a rich,
immersive feeling for what

576
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,450
these places look like
in the real world.

577
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:19,080
Now both of these techniques
that I described, they are

578
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,650
very much in their
infancy today.

579
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:24,620
We think we've taken a very big
leap forward with the new

580
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:29,130
Google Maps from what online
mapping can do these days, but

581
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,640
we still have a long
way to go forward.

582
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,130
And we hope that you've
enjoyed what we've

583
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:36,180
shown you so far.

584
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:40,220
We believe there are a lot of
still very hard, difficult

585
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:43,120
computer science problems to
solve that will keep making

586
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,580
these experiences better
and better over time.

587
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,560
And we hope you will continue
on the journey with us as we

588
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,730
try to make a mapping experience
that is truly

589
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:55,590
unique, truly for you, and truly
about every single task

590
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,570
that you do every single day.

591
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:01,220
With that, I think we'd like
to open it up for any

592
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,450
questions you might have.

593
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:06,420
There is a pair of microphones
here that you can walk up to,

594
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,910
and we'll be able to take any
kind of questions and

595
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,210
not drop the mike.

596
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:14,186

597
00:28:14,186 --> 00:28:23,130
[APPLAUSE]

598
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:25,620
AUDIENCE: I wondered when do you
think we might see the new

599
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:30,890
personalized maps showing up on
mobile, on Android AND iOS?

600
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:34,350
JONAH JONES: So the thing that
we talked about during the

601
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:37,960
keynote on Wednesday was that
we kind of came up with this

602
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:42,350
vision of how the future of
Google Maps would be as we're

603
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,510
moving forward.

604
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:46,470
So the thing that we announced
on desktop on Wednesday was

605
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:49,570
the desktop incarnation of where
we're heading towards in

606
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:52,360
that future, and I think that
as time progresses, you're

607
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,260
going to generally see this kind
of experience be mirrored

608
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,450
across all different devices,
because we want everyone to

609
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:01,450
have a very seamless experience
across all devices.

610
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:04,380
So the desktop is a preview
of where we are now.

611
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,770
YATIN CHAWATHE: So
what we have now

612
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,750
is the desktop version.

613
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:11,100
We will continue to work on
improving our look and feel of

614
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,545
Maps and unifying them across
all of our platforms.

615
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:17,040

616
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,165
AUDIENCE: In terms of how the
new mapping system relates to

617
00:29:20,165 --> 00:29:22,830
the old mapping system, how much
extra does it cost you in

618
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,990
terms of compute power
to do this?

619
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:28,470
And is there any saving in
terms of data flow from

620
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,720
cutting down these maps?

621
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,380

622
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,170
YATIN CHAWATHE: I can't go into
a lot of specifics on

623
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:40,400
exactly what is different, but
we take advantage of a lot of

624
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:45,930
different levels of both
simplification and easier and

625
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:49,470
better serving systems to allow
us to build these maps.

626
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:54,170
So, obviously, creating a map
on the fly for every single

627
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:57,260
user, every single task that
they perform, is going to take

628
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,140
more computing power.

629
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:02,150
But we try to be fairly
efficient about how we go

630
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:05,340
about doing it so it doesn't
become an overwhelming thing.

631
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,830
Even for Google, we do want to
be conscious about not using a

632
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:12,440
lot of compute power, so we try
to be fairly efficient.

633
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,190
JONAH JONES: There's a
distinction between, of

634
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:16,540
course, client side computing
power and the server side

635
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:19,080
computing power as well, so in
terms of the download that you

636
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,280
get to your local machine,
the amount of data

637
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,780
we send should be--

638
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,390
for the basic map case-- should
be similar or even less

639
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,710
because it's more efficient
with sending vector maps.

640
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,590
YATIN CHAWATHE: That is true.

641
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:31,520
Because we send vector data down
to the client, now the

642
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,180
total amount of data
that we send to the

643
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,550
client is much lower.

644
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:39,110
And we can take advantage of all
of the compute power that

645
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,820
each of you have to draw
the map for us.

646
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:46,080
So that becomes a shared
responsibility where we do all

647
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,420
the hard work in our
infrastructure and then send

648
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,847
very simple information down
to the client and allow the

649
00:30:50,847 --> 00:30:53,350
client to render stuff.

650
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:56,000
AUDIENCE: I think one of the
most interesting things was

651
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,200
the way you guys did the WebGL
rendering in the browser.

652
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,860
And reading the media coverage
about this, it doesn't seem

653
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,290
like anybody noticed that.

654
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:05,230
I was wondering if you could
talk a little bit about the

655
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,770
challenges of doing that.

656
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:10,380
I'm specifically interested in
how you're able to share that

657
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,330
code across all the different
platforms you're supporting

658
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:14,910
including Android and iOS.

659
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:19,050
YATIN CHAWATHE: So the WebGL
stuff that we worked on is

660
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,700
primarily for desktop.

661
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:24,090
The vector maps that our mobile
platforms use, use a

662
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,650
native variant of it.

663
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:30,550
We do try to share a lot of
themes across all of these

664
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:33,540
platforms, so we have the same
look and feel for the Maps no

665
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,550
matter which platform
you're browsing on.

666
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:40,410
So when it comes to a bunch of
the 3D rendering, we share a

667
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:44,300
number of the low level shader
code that each of these

668
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:49,440
platforms rely on, but then
WebGL, iOS, and Android have

669
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,340
their own variants of
implementation on top of that

670
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,318
that are native to the platforms
that we work on.

671
00:31:56,318 --> 00:32:00,110

672
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,945
AUDIENCE: So what you showed
here is a very cool, but you

673
00:32:02,945 --> 00:32:05,200
said it is still in
an early stage.

674
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,300
What I'm curious to know is,
what are the major areas you

675
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:14,260
see that needs to be enhanced?

676
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,420
YATIN CHAWATHE: Be enhanced?

677
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,090
Sure.

678
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:21,460
There's a lot of improvement
we can make to our product

679
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,780
every single time.

680
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:27,270
We are very proud and very
happy about how far we've

681
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:30,280
come, but there is so much
more that can be done.

682
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,780
A map that is truly about
you continues to evolve.

683
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:41,680
As I evolve, as you evolve, what
we expect out of online

684
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,380
maps evolves.

685
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,980
We're going to continue
to want to improve it.

686
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:49,400
So we see this sort of as just
one step forward in what

687
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,320
people will come to expect
out of online maps.

688
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,420
As people get to used to this
new way of exploring the

689
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:59,800
world, there will be newer and
newer things that we'll want

690
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,040
to do with our maps.

691
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,620
There's a number of interesting
ideas that

692
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,080
hopefully we'll be able to share
with the world as we

693
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:09,040
start building those and
creating an even richer

694
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,650
experience.

695
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,690
JONAH JONES: Yeah, I think
it's a really interesting

696
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,230
challenge, because the two
things that we showed today

697
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,980
are kind of trying to
algorithmically generate

698
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,430
something that a talented human
would be able to do, and

699
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,640
that's really tough, right?

700
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,350
So I feel like the fact that
we've got as far as we have

701
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:28,000
with the 3D tool is amazing,
but that's still--

702
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,280
if it were a human doing it, it
would become a mediocre 3D

703
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:30,910
tour, right?

704
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:32,460
And wouldn't it be amazing
if the 3D tour could be

705
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,740
incredible like one of the top
directors has done it.

706
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,890
And very similar with
the hand drawn maps.

707
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,980
I think it's amazing how far
we've come, but there's still

708
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,390
a long way we can
go with that.

709
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:45,050

710
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:47,150
AUDIENCE: Do you have a fixed
database of landmarks for

711
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,810
which you generate the 3D tours,
or is it just possible

712
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:52,525
for anyone to ask for a
3D tour of any place,

713
00:33:52,525 --> 00:33:54,180
essentially, on the planet?

714
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,640
YATIN CHAWATHE: We--

715
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,510
it varies.

716
00:33:56,510 --> 00:34:00,790
So, we can create the 3D tour of
any place for which we have

717
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,470
a large number of photos.

718
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:04,650
You do require a reasonable
number of photos.

719
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:07,250
If you only have five to 10
photos, you can't really

720
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:10,440
extract a rich enough 3D
structure out of that.

721
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,409
But once you have enough photos
of a place, then it's

722
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:15,764
pretty easy to create
a 3D tour of that.

723
00:34:15,764 --> 00:34:19,159
Now, obviously, we don't have
anything in our current

724
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:22,610
product that allows you to
just create a 3D tour of

725
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:24,699
something that you
generate, but--

726
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:27,409
so what we take into account
are signals like, what are

727
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:30,210
places that are going to be
interesting to our users, what

728
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:33,730
are the most relevant places
for, say, any given city

729
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:36,820
around the world, and try to
take those signals into

730
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,820
account when we figure
out where we want to

731
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,590
publish these 3D tours.

732
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,429
But the basic concept--

733
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:46,750
if you took 1,000 photos of your
house, you would be able

734
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,620
to create a 3D tour
of your house.

735
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,159
JONAH JONES: If everyone in
this room went outside and

736
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,860
took a photo of the Moscone
Center, we'd probably have a

737
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,219
Moscone Center tour
pretty soon.

738
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:56,639
AUDIENCE: So do you choose these
places manually, or is

739
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,150
there some algorithm that
chooses those places?

740
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:00,260
YATIN CHAWATHE: No , we don't
choose them manually, it's

741
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,560
algorithmic, there's
many, many tours

742
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,710
around the whole world.

743
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,540
So, yeah, there's a whole bunch
of algorithms and a

744
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,880
number of signals
that go into it.

745
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,050
Basically, at a very high
level, it's driven by

746
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,680
popularity.

747
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,590
The most popular places we
want to create tours for.

748
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:16,930

749
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:18,980
AUDIENCE: Somewhat related to
the previous question, when

750
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,960
you're looking at all these
thousands of photos, is there

751
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,740
some level of manual filtering
that you do with the photos,

752
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,720
as well, or is it purely
algorithmic?

753
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,680
YATIN CHAWATHE: The first pass
is purely algorithmic.

754
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,480
We do perform some manual
moderation to verify that the

755
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,180
algorithms work well.

756
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:37,990
That will go down over time as
we gain more confidence and as

757
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:41,090
we gain more signals to feed
into our algorithms.

758
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:45,000
JONAH JONES: I think there's
quite a lot of manual work

759
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,480
that goes even before this as
well, right, because the

760
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,370
photos that are selected are the
popular ones for Panoramio

761
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:52,260
or from Picasa.

762
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,060
And something being popular is
obviously a very, very human

763
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,000
thing which is, people like it,
they share it, all of that

764
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,490
kind of thing.

765
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,670
So there is very much a human
element in the beginning

766
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:00,840
[INAUDIBLE]

767
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,100
about the popularity, and
then the algorithm

768
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:03,850
takes over from there.

769
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:06,140
YATIN CHAWATHE: And that
manual work is taking

770
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:09,490
advantage of the immense
human computing power

771
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:10,740
of the entire world.

772
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:14,040

773
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,450
AUDIENCE: Just to touch back on
the idea that if I was to

774
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:21,410
take 1,000 photos of my house,
a 3D tour could be

775
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:22,180
created around it.

776
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:26,700
Is that a service that you
might want to offer to

777
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:30,350
amateurs like me, that I could
plug a bunch of photos in and

778
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:31,400
it would do that for me?

779
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,710
YATIN CHAWATHE: It sounds like
a great idea, we'll have to

780
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,960
take it into account.

781
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,800

782
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,050
Any more questions?

783
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:45,380

784
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:48,058
I don't think there's anything
else here, but--

785
00:36:48,058 --> 00:36:54,046

786
00:36:54,046 --> 00:36:55,940
JONAH JONES: We're lucky that
didn't happen in the keynote.

787
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,580
[LAUGHTER]

788
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,450
YATIN CHAWATHE: All right, this

789
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,546
thing has the old password.

790
00:37:00,546 --> 00:37:02,480
JONAH JONES: All right.

791
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,610
It looks like that's all the
questions then, so, thank you

792
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:05,620
everyone for coming.

793
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:10,833
[APPLAUSE]
