00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,380

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,120
IDO GREEN: Hello, everyone.

3
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,300
I'm Ido Green and I'm a
Developer Advocate.

4
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,190
DANNY HERMES: And I'm Danny
Hermes, Developer Programs

5
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:10,360
Engineer, working on the
cloud app engine.

6
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,530
And we're here to show you our
demo, which yesterday, it was

7
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:15,215
an offline demo.

8
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:17,070
It actually never wanted
to come online.

9
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,240
So if you want to see the full
talk, check out the link at

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,550
the bottom of this video.

11
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,420
The talk was "Mobile Web and the
Cloud, the Triple Crown of

12
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,000
Modern Applications".

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,450
And so here we go,
on to the demo.

14
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:29,970
Let's jump on to the device.

15
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:30,740
Let's see it, Ido.

16
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:31,280
IDO GREEN: Great.

17
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,470
So we have here a mobile
web application.

18
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,730
And first thing we need just
to authenticate our users.

19
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,670
So we sign in with G+, which
is extremely easy, and you

20
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,190
could check the code
on GitHub.

21
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,070
I'm accepting the confirmation
dialog here.

22
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,930
And now when I'm back, you
could see a few things.

23
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,170
One, the sign-in button
vanished.

24
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,400
And the app itself now made a
connection to the server and

25
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,710
brought us all the nice
pictures that we took

26
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:55,820
beforehand.

27
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,510
Now as you can see, I have
here this crucial

28
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,420
functionality to add photos.

29
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,980
And here natively, in the
browser, I can just click on

30
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,760
Take Photo.

31
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:11,520
And very nicely, I'll try
to give you a view

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,570
of what we are seeing.

33
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,180
And you could see that
the photo loaded.

34
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,930
I can just give it a name.

35
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:17,660
Google.

36
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,410
DANNY HERMES: Yeah, a great
photo of the studio we're

37
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,170
filming in.

38
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,994
IDO GREEN: GDL.

39
00:01:22,994 --> 00:01:27,186
And I can save it.

40
00:01:27,186 --> 00:01:29,140
Now when I was saving it, a
few things happened in the

41
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:29,670
background.

42
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,400
First thing, and the most
important one, is that we got

43
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,840
a confirmation first
that the photo

44
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,470
itself was saved locally.

45
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,520
Then we got a confirmation that
the photo was sent to the

46
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,540
cloud to our one source of
true that we want to have

47
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,370
there, so we could see it
on different devices.

48
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,120
DANNY HERMES: So if we switch
to the laptop, where our

49
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,740
wonderful user Wadsworth Testing
10 has already signed

50
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,000
in, and I refresh this page,
we wait a little bit and we

51
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,870
actually see that photo there
on another device.

52
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,900
So heading back to
the device--

53
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,010
IDO GREEN: Now let's take
it to the next level.

54
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,940
As we spoke yesterday, we want
to make sure that our app will

55
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:07,850
be productive and could let the
user work when we don't

56
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,850
have any connection, or we
have flaky connections.

57
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,510
So here I'll do something
quite brave.

58
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,590
And just remember that
we are in a browser.

59
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:18,310
I'm just now releasing
the connection.

60
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,730
And you could see up on the top
left corner that we have

61
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,400
the offline indicator, and
we are now offline.

62
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,160
And I can still go,
add a photo.

63
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,250
Take another nice photo
of our studio here.

64
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,800
And a few things will
happen now.

65
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,700
So I captured a photo.

66
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,130
I can give it a quick
name and a quick

67
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,640
description, and save it.

68
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,930
Now when I'm saving it right
now, you could see that on get

69
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,250
confirmation immediately
that the photo itself

70
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,410
is now saved locally.

71
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,950
DANNY HERMES: But if we switch
over to the laptop--

72
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,480
IDO GREEN: --the magic
will happen.

73
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,350
DANNY HERMES: --and we try to
refresh, we will see, we don't

74
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,780
have the photo yet.

75
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,370
But if we go back--

76
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,230
IDO GREEN: Now let's go
back to the tablet.

77
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,520
And you could see that then once
I'm switching and hooking

78
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,700
it back and giving it a
connection, first you see the

79
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,530
indicator on the top changing
from red to green and ready.

80
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,410
And now our photo is being
sent to the cloud.

81
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,180
DANNY HERMES: Sent
to the cloud.

82
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,040
So if we check out one last time
on Wadsworth Testing 10's

83
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,480
laptop, and we refresh it and we
wait a bit, we actually got

84
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,600
that connection back
and we see it.

85
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,180
So that concludes our demo.

86
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,020
Thank you for stopping here.

87
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,800
Again, I encourage you to
go see the whole talk.

88
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,670
But chances are, you actually
came here from

89
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,690
the original talk.

90
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,850
I hope you enjoyed this.

91
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,210
And we hope you'll check out
some of the other videos from

92
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,020
Google I/O.

93
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,730
IDO GREEN: Absolutely.

94
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,880
And check in the latest and
greatest in HTML5 [INAUDIBLE]

95
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,010
dot com, and build
amazing web apps.

96
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,260
Thank you.

97
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,383
