1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,390

2
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,880
FEMALE SPEAKER: So now we're
going to shift, and we're

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:10,270
going to hear an amazing talk by
a hardware lead at Google.

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,150
Jean Wang has a PhD
in electrical

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,670
engineering in photonics.

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,880
She worked in the optical
communications and

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,690
then came to Google.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,270
She's the hardware lead
on Google Glass.

9
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,440
As a board member, I
have Google Glass.

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,790
I love it.

11
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,420
It's so much more natural
than a phone.

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,690
And now you get to hear about
how she did this.

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,710

14
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:40,200
Thank you.

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,200
[APPLAUSE]

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,050
JEAN WANG: Hi, everybody.

17
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,300
Smile.

18
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,480

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,380
So I'm very happy to be
here with you today.

20
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,000
I'd like to share with
you my Glass journey.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,050
It's a three-part story that
spans across multiple domains.

22
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,160
And while it is yet unfinished,
I hope you share

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,270
my enthusiasm for what
is yet to come.

24
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,360
Before diving in, I'd actually
like to float this number

25
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,550
briefly and plant it
in your minds.

26
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,870
It has significance to me and
the story, and in the

27
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,360
meantime, please feel free
to question the number

28
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,610
base that I'm using.

29
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,990

30
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:22,160
So, Glass, like many ideas,
started as a blank canvas.

31
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,280
As part of the initial team,
we came into the project

32
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,750
largely inexperienced
in the field of

33
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,420
head-mounted displays.

34
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,510
Instead, we had the ability to
divide and conquer through our

35
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,120
ability to learn and adapt.

36
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,250
While some of us focused on
optics, like myself, others

37
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,370
worked on cameras, sensor
systems, electronics.

38
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:42,390
And so we also came in with the
fundamental belief that

39
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,110
technology had ripened to the
point where we can make a

40
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:48,860
significant impact and create
something of significant use.

41
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:54,080
And that has led us into the
discovery phase, to find out

42
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,650
just what it was that could be
done to basically minimize the

43
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,000
barrier to information access,
and to make us connect with

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,250
each other in terms of accessing
our social sphere.

45
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,820
As part of the discovery
process, we looked at existing

46
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,200
products in the mobile space
and wanted to really

47
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,280
understand where it was that we
can make an impact in terms

48
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,790
of form factor.

49
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,890
For example, whether it was
bulky and had to fit into our

50
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,930
pocket or carry around a bag
for it; ease of access,

51
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,820
whether we had to pull it out
of our pocket or a bag to

52
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,580
actually engage with it; and
also ease of use, whether we

53
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,780
were blocked when we were using
the device, or whether

54
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,310
we could look straight ahead and
talk with people and not

55
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,990
be distracted.

56
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,080
So to push on these pain points,
we did a number of

57
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,630
technical experiments.

58
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:42,120
Here's a helmet-mounted display
that did not allow us

59
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,670
to be hands free
or wires free.

60
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,130
And in the bottom, you can see
here, is an early optical

61
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,260
experiment to help us understand
the technical

62
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,620
complexities in terms of how
optics sizes actually impact

63
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,570
the performance and
the image quality.

64
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,650
So with these considerations
in mind, we dived into

65
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,140
selecting components that
we could use to

66
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,390
make a viable solution.

67
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,070

68
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,690
So in the vast array of options,
we looked at what it

69
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,910
was we could just reuse
and customize.

70
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,020
Or was there something that we
had to invent for ourselves?

71
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,980
So we played around with a bunch
of pico projectors and

72
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,990
projectors.

73
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,250
We looked at optic components
such as lenses and prisms as

74
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,650
well as interface devices--

75
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,020
touch pads, microphones,
speakers.

76
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,410
And underpinning the whole
system was electrical

77
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:30,250
components and board design.

78
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,790
So in this huge selection of
choices and huge array of

79
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,350
options, how do we
down-select?

80
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,540
And so we filtered using
two key criteria.

81
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,020
One was power consumption,
and a second was weight.

82
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:48,800
So these two are basically
factors in enabling us to

83
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,840
first, wear a system all day,
and second, actually allow us

84
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,890
to want to wear a
system all day.

85
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,295
So we headed into the second
phase of prototyping.

86
00:03:58,295 --> 00:04:01,510

87
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:06,410
Here are six example generations
of glass

88
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,810
prototypes.

89
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,200
Starting at the very top left,
we took the lowest hanging

90
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,585
fruit of simply putting mobile
phones to the side of the

91
00:04:13,585 --> 00:04:17,720
head, and a pico projector
shining directly into the eye

92
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,450
to provide the image.

93
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:22,100
And so this was a bit bulky,
as you can imagine.

94
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,750
It came in at 167 grams.

95
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,300
And we wisely decided that we
could lighten the load by

96
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,010
taking the mechanicals
off the phone.

97
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,860
And that's our second proto
shown right up there in the

98
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,320
middle top.

99
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,460
And so as you can see, over
time, we shifted from using

100
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,250
off-the-shelf components, such
as safety shields and frames,

101
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,610
into 3D printing
our own frame.

102
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,160
And that's shown here
in the third.

103
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,060
And you can also see that we
migrated into making our own

104
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,540
optical design and architecture,
which is

105
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,880
something we carry
through today.

106
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,310
And as you gradually evolve to
the very end, you see that

107
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,660
more and more we use customized
components.

108
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,920
And we look at making our own
plastics and metals to get to

109
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,520
where we are today, which is
essentially the essence of

110
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,400
what Glass needs to be.

111
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,440
This provides the core, and
provides a very minimalistic

112
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,940
system, that allows us to run
around and be happy when we're

113
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,722
playing with the system.

114
00:05:12,722 --> 00:05:16,340
And in addition to prototyping
with the hardware, Glass

115
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:20,940
derives its use from
easy to follow UI.

116
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:24,760
And this is by definition
actually easy to make.

117
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,850
Along the way, we experimented
with a number of different

118
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:30,440
interaction concepts, for
example, head gestures.

119
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,700
And that recent SNL skit was not
too far from our previous

120
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,960
truth, if you've seen it.

121
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,640
Also, we experimented with
porting the keyword

122
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,950
functionality to the touchpad.

123
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,720
But we found that was a bit too
complex, even when running

124
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,670
in a predictive word mode.

125
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,210
We also tuned the number
of lines of text--

126
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,330
the font, the size--

127
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,470
to basically optimize
for readability.

128
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,010
So through all of these
things, we found that

129
00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:00,350
minimalizing and stripping down
to the very core allowed

130
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:04,050
for the best use case
and experience.

131
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:08,740
We also found that minor head
tilts and voice commands

132
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,580
allowed us for hands-free
experience, which is very

133
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,270
important when we're
busy dancing or

134
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,090
riding that roller coaster.

135
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,930
On the flip side, having the
touchpad and the camera button

136
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,920
allowed us for more quiet
modes of interaction.

137
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:29,080
So with the hardware and
software solutions converging

138
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,840
into a viable state, the team
actually turned to the

139
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,790
question of production.

140
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:38,480
It is possible to manually tweak
and baby one device, to

141
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,430
get it to be close to ideal
in terms of cosmetics and

142
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,110
functionality.

143
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,460
However, we'd like to share
Glass more broadly.

144
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,850
And so that, to us,
quickly turns into

145
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,930
the question of scale.

146
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:53,500
How do we build not 1, 1,000,
100,000, but upward towards a

147
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,392
googol of devices?

148
00:06:55,392 --> 00:06:58,290
Layering in automation
is key to this.

149
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:02,250
And that means that not only
do we have to build Glass

150
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,590
itself, but we have to build

151
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,930
infrastructure that builds Glass--

152
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,030
this floor space, the
equipment, the

153
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,250
whole kit and caboodle.

154
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,250
And to add a bit more
complexity, we'd like to honor

155
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,250
individuality and human
preferences.

156
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:23,160
And that to us, has meant color
options, and that leads

157
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,280
to color complexity.

158
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,930
How do we make sure that on
the device itself, part to

159
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,700
part, the colors match?

160
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,830
And how do we make
sure that between

161
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,880
devices the colors match?

162
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,030
So production requires the
solutions to all of these

163
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,760
questions and beyond.

164
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,250
Through these three phases of
discovery, prototyping, and

165
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:48,680
production, I have found that
Glass is both an innovation

166
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,930
and a reinvention.

167
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:55,410
By integrating highly compact
and new components, we've been

168
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:58,820
able to extend far beyond nickel
head-mounted displays,

169
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,840
beyond the last couple decades
of individualized movie

170
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,330
players, game consoles,
and aircraft systems.

171
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:08,930
On other hand, I think that
Glass is a way in which we can

172
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,840
examine and develop new fields
that we can push beyond and

173
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,000
learn to be better connected to
each other as well as share

174
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,620
perspective and have access
to information.

175
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,870
And all of this will allow us to
better empathize as people

176
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,360
and sympathize.

177
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,670
So coming back to that number
at the very beginning.

178
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:32,760
It's been exactly, as
of today, 1,111

179
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,510
days since I joined.

180
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,330
And this is a picture I
would not be able to

181
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,220
take without Glass.

182
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,530
I am paragliding over Coronet
Peak, New Zealand.

183
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:44,020
And just by looking at it, I can
recall what it was like to

184
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,670
soar with the birds
and to take in the

185
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:49,100
beauty of the landscape.

186
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,955
I have often been asked what the
a-ha moments have been in

187
00:08:50,955 --> 00:08:52,520
the project thus far.

188
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,500
And while I have a few, I
am more excited about

189
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,300
what is yet to come.

190
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,410
There is a first tier, for
example, a bar code, QR code

191
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,850
scans, where we can get
just-in-time reviews of

192
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:07,560
movies, books, that menu trace
we're just about to take, but

193
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,360
we're not quite sure yet.

194
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,850
Then there's also never getting
lost and not bumping

195
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,870
into things while you're
looking at directions.

196
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,270
And then there's a whole
other level.

197
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,910
Recently one of my colleagues
exchanged his wedding vows

198
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,540
while wearing the device.

199
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:26,100
And I get goose bumps when I
imagine him reliving that when

200
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,650
he is old and gray and seeing
the reflection of a future

201
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,330
from his wife's eyes.

202
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:35,210
And then there's also a
physics instructor who

203
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,980
recently toured CERN
with the device.

204
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,240
And he did a Hangout back to
his classroom in Michigan.

205
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,030
And he was riding his bike down
the tunnel of the Large

206
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,700
Hadron Collider showing his
classroom just how cool it

207
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,820
was, while taking live questions
on the spot.

208
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,840
Then there's also another
example where Glass can mean

209
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,540
life or death, that it can
help you translate to a

210
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,290
medical doctor in a foreign
country that you're allergic

211
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,540
to penicillin.

212
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,690

213
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:08,450
So through this process, I think
that there's just so

214
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:13,140
much potential in what is yet
to come, that in pushing

215
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:17,320
towards a new perspective on
information sharing and

216
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,910
perspective sharing, we've come
upon a new environment

217
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,630
Glass can engender.

218
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:28,720
And when I have time to pause
and think about how far we've

219
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,400
come, I feel privileged to be
part of such a dynamic team.

220
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,410
Together we're striving forth
to bring forward this new

221
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,980
perspective.

222
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,610
And I count you, as developers,
as part of this

223
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,570
growing group.

224
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,630
There's just so much potential
and positive impact in keeping

225
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,170
in the moment, where information
is just at your

226
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:50,650
fingertips and knowledge is
a twinkle in your eye.

227
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,730
And with that I look forward
to your aha moments, and we

228
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,200
are back to discovery.

229
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,595
[APPLAUSE]

230
00:11:00,595 --> 00:11:07,400

231
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,650
JEAN WANG: Thanks everyone.

232
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:09,338
