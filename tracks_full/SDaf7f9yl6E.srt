00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,660
>>Ellie Powers: All right. Hi, everybody.
Good morning.

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,500
Good morning!
Good morning. Wow, it's amazing to see so

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,129
many people out in the morning, and hello
to you back there who waved to me. Thank you.

4
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:19,270
So I'm Ellie Powers. I'm the product manager
for Google Play developer, so many of you

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,910
guys here.
>>Miles Barr: Hi. I'm Miles Barr. I'm the

6
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,550
engineering manager for apps in Google Play.
>>Riccardo Govoni: Hello, I'm Riccardo, tech

7
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,390
lead for the Google Play Developer Console.
>>Ellie Powers: All right. And some of you

8
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:34,579
saw us earlier this week at I/O, and so what
we're going to be doing today is to give you

9
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:38,800
even more of what we showed you. So you will
get to see more details on the features that

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,980
we announced as well as a couple more new
things.

11
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:48,980
So let's go back in the past for a second.
Last year, Android Market -- do you remember

12
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:56,649
that? It was a recent memory. And Google Play
was brand-new. And all of you who publish

13
00:00:56,649 --> 00:01:00,610
apps on Google Play were using something that
looked like this. This is the old Developer

14
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:04,430
Console. I hope you've completely forgotten
about it but if you haven't it looked a little

15
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:10,439
bit like a Web form from 1999.
So Miles and I came on the stage at I/O last

16
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,979
year and said, guys, we've totally heard you.
Your businesses are really taking off and

17
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:18,869
you need something that's really going to
scale; right? You need some professional tools

18
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:21,899
to support all the great things that you're
doing now.

19
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:27,009
And we said, "Don't worry. We've got your
back. We've been working on something great."

20
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:31,799
It's the new Developer Console.
So back in London where we're all based, we

21
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:37,369
were excited to see your response. You started
sending us thousands of pieces of feedback.

22
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:41,979
It just all started pouring in. And many of
you may be wondering, I sent in that feedback

23
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:46,079
and then what happened? Did anyone read it?
Did it just go into a hole?

24
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,959
So I can tell you, rest assured, your feedback
was read, and I know that because I actually

25
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,490
read every single piece of feedback that you
sent in via the feedback ling at the top of

26
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,060
the new Developer Console.
So I can tell you that, actually, we were

27
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,569
delighted to see that the number one piece
of feedback that came in was, hey, guys, this

28
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:06,639
new Developer Console, it's a lot better than
the old one.

29
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:09,509
And so we were relieved that at least we were
going in the right direction.

30
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:13,200
[ Applause ]
>>Ellie Powers: All right. Thank you! Thank

31
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,739
you so much.
We were absolutely delighted to see that positive

32
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:21,400
response. But also what started coming in
was a bunch of feature requests. "Hey, this

33
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,370
is great, but." "Could you also do." "How
about this?" "I also need that." "You really

34
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,310
should be doing more."
And we said absolutely. We totally agree with

35
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,319
that. And so that's why we've been rolling
out a ton of new features.

36
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,090
So what we're going to do today for you here
with some great demos is to show you how Google

37
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:45,819
Play is evolving rapidly. We're rapidly moving
to bring you tons of new features that are

38
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:50,349
going to grow with your business and help
you support Google Play's enormous audience

39
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:52,189
around the world.
So let's walk through what we're going to

40
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:54,659
do today.
So again, we're going to be going into more

41
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:57,799
detail on what you've already seen and also
seeing new stuff.

42
00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:02,329
We're going to be going through three different
areas. We have publishing your app your way

43
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:07,310
on Google Play, how you can take control of
publishing in our store, connecting directly

44
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,459
with customers.
Secondly, we're going to be talking about

45
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:15,269
optimizing your app, how we're giving you
more data so you can deeper into how people

46
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:19,920
are using your app and improve it. And then,
finally, how you can expand your app globally

47
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,700
to take advantage of Google Play's global
footprint and reach more audiences in new

48
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,689
markets, expanding your business.
So without further ado, we're going to look

49
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:31,469
at cool new stuff, and Miles Barr is going
to take us through that.

50
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:35,659
>>Miles Barr: Thanks, Ellie. I want to start
today by talking about how Google Play keeps

51
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:40,459
you in control of publishing your app. Our
philosophy has always been to put no barriers

52
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:44,540
between you and your users. When you have
a new version of your app ready, you can push

53
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:49,810
it out to everyone at the same time.
This can be very daunting, though, as anyone

54
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:54,290
who has pushed a new app with a serious bug
knows, so we figured we can do better.

55
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,810
So I was happy to announce on Wednesday that
we launched the beta testing and staged rollout

56
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:03,999
feature in Google Play. This means you can
start testing a new version of your app with

57
00:04:03,999 --> 00:04:08,739
a small group of alpha testers, and when it's
ready, move on to a larger group of beta testers,

58
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:11,709
and once you're comfortable that your app
is ready for prime time, you can roll out

59
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:17,389
in stages to the rest of your user base.
This means you can keep your startup's new

60
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:21,640
apps under wraps. You can try out a major
new UI with just your power users, or you

61
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:28,640
can even give a preview to the press.
And why is this important? Because we want

62
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:33,780
to ensure that your users are always happy
with your app.

63
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:40,260
So let's take a look at how this works.
Here we are in the Developer Console. As you

64
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:45,690
can see, there are two new tabs, alpha testing
and beta testing. These are essentially the

65
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:50,540
same thing. They're two targeted groups that
allows you to send a version of your app to

66
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:56,410
specific set of users. If your user is in
both tests, they will receive the alpha one.

67
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:02,240
At Google, our philosophy is to test our software
early and often, so whenever a build is ready,

68
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,910
we send it to our team so they can try it
out. So let's switch to the alpha. So we'll

69
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:10,050
do the same here.
So first we've got our new APK, and what we're

70
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,110
going to do is we're going to target our team,
and we're going to do this with a mailing

71
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:18,300
list. So Riccardo is entering our team mailing
list here.

72
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,500
Now, when you target a user for a beta test
or an alpha test, they are not automatically

73
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,750
opted in. For them to receive the version,
they need to go to this link here and opt

74
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:33,740
into the test. And this is available on the
Web and on the phone, and it explains to your

75
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,810
users what being a tester is and they can
opt in. And if at any point they want to opt

76
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,440
out of the test, they can come back to the
same page, opt out and uninstall the test

77
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:48,440
version of your app.
Now, beta test and alpha test are private.

78
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,970
What this means is until a user opts in to
your test, they'll see no details about the

79
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:58,310
app on the Play Store.
Similarly, we don't allow reviews of prerelease

80
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,030
versions, so none of the details of your new
app will leak.

81
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:07,410
We recommend using mailing list or Google+
community to talk to your testers. We do collect

82
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:11,030
statistics and crash report data on your test
versions so you can track the progress of

83
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:15,180
how it's going.
So let's say the alpha test has gone great

84
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:20,890
so we're going to move it to beta. And this
time we want to have a wider set of testers

85
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:25,110
so instead of a mailing list I'm going to
use a Google+ community.

86
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:30,610
This community some of our most engaged users.
They love our app. They love testing early

87
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,680
versions and giving us feedback on the new
features.

88
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,080
So Riccardo is going to just let the group
know that we've got a new beta test ready

89
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:45,080
and they can opt in.
Now, when setting up a beta test, it's important

90
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,690
to get a good representation of your users,
and by this I mean make sure you have a good

91
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:53,070
mix of devices, people who speak different
languages and people on different carriers.

92
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:57,410
You want to ensure your app works for everyone
once you publish it.

93
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:02,160
Okay. So we've got a lot of feedback for our
beta test, we fix some bugs, and this latest

94
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,970
version we're comfortable with, so we want
to get it out to production. I'm feeling pretty

95
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:10,060
good about it because it's been through so
many rounds of testing, but sometimes a bug

96
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:15,610
does slip through, and what happens when you
launch it? That means you get a lot of unhappy

97
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,400
users and one-star reviews.
So we're going to be on the safe side here

98
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,320
and we're going to do a stage rollout. So
rather than choosing everyone, we're going

99
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:29,100
to start with about 10% of our users.
At this point users can now review your app

100
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,390
so you can see the feedback of how it's doing.
And if there's a problem, you can stop the

101
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:38,510
rollout, create a fix, and then we'll push
that fixed version to that same original 10%

102
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:43,420
of users.
>>Riccardo Govoni: Shall we go to everybody?

103
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,790
>>Miles Barr: Hmm?
>>Riccardo Govoni: Shall we go to everybody?

104
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:52,790
>>Miles Barr: Yep, let's go to everyone.
All right. And you can also use this feature

105
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:57,470
to control traffic to your back-ends. We know
sometimes when you release a new version of

106
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:02,610
your app, the traffic patterns differ. So
by just looking at 10%, making sure your back-end

107
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:09,610
servers can handle the load, you can be sure
once you push it to everyone, your app will

108
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,140
work great.
Okay. Let's hear about how someone has been

109
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:16,980
using beta testing. Wattpad is a great app
that gives you access to over 10 million free

110
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:22,100
books and short stories. They have been beta
testing since the beginning and they do this

111
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,780
by having two different apps in the Play Store,
the beta version and live one. The beta version

112
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:32,519
they push every week and the live one about
once a month. Each feature they add to their

113
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,240
app goes through three to four rounds of beta
testing, so they get lots of feedback and

114
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,570
they decide if it makes the cut and should
go to the multi-release.

115
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:45,070
A great example of this is the new UI you
see up here. They recently changed how users'

116
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:49,820
books appear in their library. This is quite
a big change. They wanted to see how users

117
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:56,270
react to it. Unsurprisingly, they found that
some users got it, some didn't. There was

118
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:00,870
a bit of confusion. So before they launched
it, they added a tutorial section explaining

119
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:05,190
what the change was and of how to find your
books. This led to a seamless rollout to the

120
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:12,190
rest of their users.
Previously, while they have been beta testing

121
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,370
before we launched our feature, this meant
that they had to create two listings and also

122
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:21,320
manage their testers outside of Google Play.
With the launch of today's feature, you can

123
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,380
retain store listing and also use Google tools
like Google groups and Google+ communities

124
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:33,380
to manage your testers.
All right. Wattpad has a huge beta testing

125
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:42,090
community of 25,000 users but they've told
us that they've seen benefits back when they

126
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:47,610
only had ten users. This gave them access
to a wider range of devices than their testing

127
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:53,630
in-house and it also meant they got early
testing from real users. So if you only get

128
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:57,240
one star again, you know you haven't been
beta testing.

129
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,840
All right. Now I want to talk to you about
tablets.

130
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,420
There are over 900 million Android devices
activated now, and a growing part of that

131
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:12,930
is tablets.
On androiddeveloper.com, we now show you the

132
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:18,250
proportion of devices by screen size and screen
density. Tablets have large and extra large

133
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:23,330
screens, so you can get a good idea of how
many tablets are out there.

134
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:27,980
Also on developer.android.com we've launched
the tablet app called a checklist. This explains

135
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,330
Google's criteria of what makes a good tablet
app and gives you advice on how to optimize

136
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:37,510
your app for tablets. If you haven't seen
this already, please go to developer.android.com

137
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:43,110
and check it out.
Also, in the Developer Console, here in the

138
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:47,960
optimization tip section, we automatically
scan an app against the checklist to see how

139
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,960
you're doing. If there's anything which your
app doesn't meet, we explain it and tell you

140
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,570
how to fix it.
So it's important to follow these tips so

141
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:59,950
you create a great tablet experience for your
users.

142
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:05,870
Also, once you created a great new tablet
UI, nice multi-pane using the fragments API,

143
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:10,020
you want to show it off. So last month in
the Play Store we gave you the ability to

144
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:14,029
upload tablet screen shots so you can show
how your app will look on a seven-inch and

145
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:19,350
ten-inch tablet.
When a user goes to the Play Store on a tablet,

146
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:24,900
they'll see the tablet screen shots first,
and on the phone, they'll see the phone ones.

147
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,279
On Wednesday we announced that the top lists
on tablets will be able to be filtered down

148
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:32,170
so users will only see those apps designed
specifically for tablets.

149
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:36,070
[ Applause ]
>>Miles Barr: Thanks.

150
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:41,890
So make sure you follow all these guidelines
so your app doesn't get left behind.

151
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:45,500
So let's take a look at a great tablet app.
I'm sure you've heard of Evernote. If you

152
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,020
haven't, it's an app that lets you collect
notes, record Web pages, everything, and keeps

153
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:54,870
you -- syncs across all your devices.
Evernote has been creating a tablet app ever

154
00:11:54,870 --> 00:12:01,870
since we launched Honeycomb back in 2011.
They created a beautiful multi-pane UI and

155
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,290
spent a lot of hard work on their tablet experience.
It's all this hard work that's kept them a

156
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:14,250
consistent editor's choice in Google Play.
And it's not just a hit with us. It's also

157
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:18,130
a hit with their users. As you can see here,
the second most popular device is a Nexus

158
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:22,860
7, a tablet.
Evernote has thought long and hard about what

159
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,710
makes a good tablet experience. If I'm on
the phone, their users want to take -- call

160
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:30,420
it a Quick Note, will maybe pull up a piece
of information, but on a tablet they spend

161
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,970
a lot more time organizing and planning and
getting real work done.

162
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:40,970
Here is what the V.P. of product had to say.
By focusing on creating a great tablet experience,

163
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,130
they created more engaged users, and these
users have gone on to become paid subscribers

164
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:52,690
of Evernote.
All right. Now I want to talk about a feature

165
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:57,220
that's coming later this summer. A lot of
you have sort of told us you want to give

166
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,610
access to the console to a lot of more people
in your company. In fact if you were in the

167
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:06,700
Fireside Chat yesterday, a lot of you asked
for finer grain controls to the Developer

168
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:11,600
Console. So late this summer we'll be releasing
several new permissions in the Play Store

169
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,770
allowing you to control exactly what each
of your users can do. And these permissions

170
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:20,540
can also be set on a per-application basis.
So if you ever wanted to give someone in your

171
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:25,050
company access to your stats but make sure
they don't mess around with your APKs, you'll

172
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:32,050
soon be able to do that so please stay tuned.
Last year here at I/O, we announced the pilot

173
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:38,160
to our reply to reviews feature. This allowed
you as a developer to reply directly to your

174
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,900
users.
I'm happy to say after lots of rounds of testing

175
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:47,070
and tweaking we've now made this available
to every single developer on Google Play.

176
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:53,350
[ Applause ]
>>Miles Barr: It gives you a direct channel

177
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:57,170
to your users, so if you haven't started using
this already please read up on our policies

178
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:02,750
and guidelines and start replying now.
Now I'm going to tell you how one developer

179
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:07,740
has been using this feature.
TextPlus is an app that lets you chat with

180
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,990
your friends all around the world through
free SMS's and cheaper calls. TextPlus has

181
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:16,580
gone all in on replying to reviews. Everyone
on their team takes part in this, from the

182
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:20,500
engineers, the product managers, and of course
their customer support team.

183
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,990
Every day, twice a day they look to see if
they have any new reviews and reply directly

184
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:28,740
to them. By doing this they've really connected
to their users and found out where their biggest

185
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,750
pain points are.
For each negative review they try to turn

186
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:37,580
around that user's experience by giving them
advice and pointers to more help. If they

187
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:41,339
succeed those users typically change their
review to a positive one.

188
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:46,380
But they don't stop just there. For their
positive reviews, the five-star reviews, they

189
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,950
find these reviews are their most engaged
users, their biggest advocates to tell other

190
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:54,810
people about the app.
They use the reply-to-review feature to speak

191
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:59,190
directly to them to get their opinions on
new features and what else they want to see

192
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:05,360
in this app.
By focusing on the user and having this attentive

193
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,230
customer support, the newer versions of TextPlus
have a higher average higher rating in the

194
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:15,760
store than the previous versions did.
Here's what they had to say about it.

195
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,700
They have used this direct line to the users
to prioritize a what features they can focus

196
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:26,100
on and now they have happier users and higher
scores within the store.

197
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,130
Now I'm going to hand over to Riccardo, our
tech lead, to tell you more about data.

198
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:35,200
>>Riccardo Govoni: Thanks, Miles. Hello, everybody.
So Miles showed you how you have more control

199
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,470
on the way you deploy your app to your users
and how you present it to them. Now I want

200
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:44,399
to shift your attention to data. I want to
show you how Developer Console helps you make

201
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,250
informed decisions about your app and your
business and helps you figure out what is

202
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:53,480
the next most important thing to focus on.
Over the course of the last year, we expanded

203
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,980
the amount of data that we make available
in Developer Console. I think you're familiar

204
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:02,630
with the standard metrics, installs and uninstalls,
per user, per device, divided across six different

205
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:07,510
dimensions, country, SDK version, application
version, language and more. But in the past

206
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:11,310
few months we rolled out a few more metrics,
and we announced a couple, even a couple of

207
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:15,029
these were given in the keynote, so let me
focus on them for a second.

208
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:21,270
One I want to talk about now is rating stats.
Rating stats show you how the users' star

209
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:26,050
rating for your application changed over time.
This is the metric you want to look at when

210
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:29,660
you want to see whether the new version of
your application that you just rolled out

211
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,660
is getting the same good user reviews, good
user satisfaction compared to the previous

212
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:39,440
version. We offer this in two variants. So
you have the cumulative rating. This is the

213
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,170
overall aggregated rating over the lifetime
of your application. This is good for the

214
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,860
long-term view, when you want to review what
you did historically in the past and the decision

215
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,870
that you made at the time.
Another one that we offer is the daily average

216
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:57,730
rating. This is the aggregated over all daily
ratings over the lifetime of your app and

217
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:01,600
this is good for the short-term view, when
you want to spot problems early on.

218
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,350
I want to mention a couple of cases where
this is particularly useful. One is reply

219
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:10,659
to reviews.
So you can use this metric to identify segments

220
00:17:10,659 --> 00:17:15,860
of your user base where customer satisfaction
is not as good as you would expect. And from

221
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:20,850
that, you can then jump to reply to reviews,
as Miles just described, and provide dedicated

222
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:25,809
customer support exactly to those users.
On the other side it works the other way around

223
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:30,179
as well. If you're spending a lot of time
doing customer support and offering replies

224
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:34,710
to your users, then you might want to use
this metric to verify the effectiveness of

225
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:39,309
what you've done and see that you are actually
achieving the results that you are expecting.

226
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:44,419
Another feature in which this is particularly
useful is stage rollouts. Unlike offline beta

227
00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:50,090
where a user cannot leave reviews or ratings,
during stage rollout users will able to rate

228
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:53,769
and review your app. And that means when you
are at 5% of a stage rollout, if you have

229
00:17:53,769 --> 00:17:57,049
a brand-new application out there, you're
on the edge of your chair, you want to make

230
00:17:57,049 --> 00:18:01,710
sure everything is fine, you might want to
use this metric to see whether everything

231
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:06,690
is doing as well as you expect.
In this example we rolled out a new version

232
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:10,399
of our application in mid-April, the orange
line, but it never really caught up with the

233
00:18:10,399 --> 00:18:13,789
baseline, which is the green line. So this
is maybe the point where you want to pause

234
00:18:13,789 --> 00:18:19,590
your stage rollout and decide what to do.
Like all the other metrics that we have, if

235
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:23,309
the breakdown by the top ten values, like
the top ten countries, or et cetera, is not

236
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:26,999
enough, obviously you can always export as
a SVC and you get the full data payload so

237
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:32,460
you can integrate it with your tools.
Another thing we want to talk about is filtering

238
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:37,450
crash reports because we now allow you to
filter crash reports by application version,

239
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:43,070
since a few weeks. Again, now that we have
Beta testing, this is extremely useful because

240
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:47,029
it means you can look at the crash reports
that are coming only from your alpha version,

241
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:52,759
maybe it was a little more crashy, and decide
what to do. During a stage rollout, we keep

242
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:57,879
collecting crash reports so you can see and
decide what to do for your stage rollout,

243
00:18:57,879 --> 00:19:03,980
whether to pause it or continue it based on
the amount of crashes you are getting.

244
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:08,460
So now everything is fine. Users are happy.
You're not getting any crashes. Unicorns and

245
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:13,659
rainbows all over the place. It's time to
talk about money. I want to talk about the

246
00:19:13,659 --> 00:19:17,830
new page that we launched on Wednesday which
is revenue charts.

247
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:21,350
I always found it a bit annoying that just
to figure out how much money you made yesterday

248
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:26,230
you had to go to Developer Console, download
the SVC report, put in a graphic in a spreadsheet

249
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:29,820
program, aggregate everything just to see
how much money you made yesterday and I think

250
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:34,429
that was just nonsense and so we decided to
fix it and starting Wednesday you have this

251
00:19:34,429 --> 00:19:41,080
new page. How all the revenue for your app
changed over time. Aggregated daily, you can

252
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:46,509
divide it or inspect it by country and by
source of revenue, say by applications, revenue

253
00:19:46,509 --> 00:19:50,519
generated from application sales, in in-app
products or subscriptions.

254
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:53,909
I think this is great to get an overview of
how your application is doing at a glance.

255
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:57,610
You can come here every day, look at how much
money you made yesterday.

256
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:01,779
And it lets you also do some sort of analysis.
You can, you know, look at whether you are

257
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:05,690
ahead of your company targets or not, whether
some countries are performing as well as you

258
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:09,929
would expect. But I also know that many of
you want to integrate this data with your

259
00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:14,009
own custom financial reporting tools and data
pipelines.

260
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:18,609
So another thing that we're doing in the coming
few weeks is that all the financial reporting

261
00:20:18,609 --> 00:20:22,720
from the Google Play Developer Console will
be available in Google Cloud Storage. What

262
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,049
that means is that by using the utilities
provided by Google Cloud Storage, like GSU2,

263
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:31,769
you will be able to have programmatic access
to your financial reporting, to your financial

264
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:35,570
data so you can integrate it with your own
data pipelines.

265
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:41,090
The other benefit of this is that thanks to
the new permission model, granular permissions

266
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:46,029
that Miles just described, you will be able
to set up a dedicated account that will only

267
00:20:46,029 --> 00:20:50,159
have access to financial data, and only be
used for accessing financial data in cloud

268
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,989
storage. And that account will not be able
to mash up with your APK configuration or

269
00:20:53,989 --> 00:21:00,989
something. So you can separate roles there.
Okay. Let's talk about referral tracking and

270
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,269
usage.
So another thing I would like all of you to

271
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:08,989
have is one place, one single place, where
you can see all the data that pertains and

272
00:21:08,989 --> 00:21:13,119
is about your application. And I know that
many of you are using Google Analytics to

273
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:18,149
track user engagement and user interaction
with your application. But so far, the experience

274
00:21:18,149 --> 00:21:22,419
was fragmented. You had to go to the developer
console to see device and install metrics.

275
00:21:22,419 --> 00:21:28,369
You had to go to Google Analytics to see activity
and user engagement. And soon, so in the coming

276
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:32,609
few weeks, you will be able to link together
Google Analytics and Google Play Developer

277
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:37,279
Console. And what that means is that once
linked together in the Google Play Developer

278
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:41,399
Console -- sorry, in Google Analytics, you
will have access to additional new metrics.

279
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:46,869
In particular, you will be able to see how
many views, downloads, and installs your marketing

280
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:50,600
campaigns triggered on Google Play.
And this is really good, because it gives

281
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,149
you a better view of the conversion funnel.
You can see much more details about how your

282
00:21:55,149 --> 00:22:00,499
users discover your app and then want to install
your app and then became daily active users.

283
00:22:00,499 --> 00:22:07,499
This integration goes both ways. So you will
have access to engagement metrics directly

284
00:22:09,889 --> 00:22:13,320
from the play developer console. So next to
installs and other metrics, you will also

285
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:20,320
see engagement, like, number of active users.
Okay. So a few more things about optimization

286
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:27,139
tips.
So Miles spent a few minutes talking about

287
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:32,029
how you can use the optimization tips section
to learn whether your app is well designed

288
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:36,019
for tablets, whether it meets the quality
checklist requirements, and et cetera.

289
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:39,919
But I have bigger plans for the optimization
tips section. I want that to become the place

290
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:45,070
where you go to discover personalized recommendations
and insights that are specific to your app

291
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:48,919
and your context.
So starting from a few days ago, from Wednesday,

292
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:53,669
you now have additional tips present in that
section, what we call them localization tips.

293
00:22:53,669 --> 00:23:00,440
They help you how to reach a broader audience
and how to expand your app to multiple countries.

294
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,179
When you decide it's time to go global, you
know, you have to do a number of things. You

295
00:23:04,179 --> 00:23:08,169
have to localize your APK, you have to then
localize your store listings. You may even

296
00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:13,399
want to consider localizing your screen shots,
because for some markets, that's really important.

297
00:23:13,399 --> 00:23:17,330
And most importantly, you have to decide which
countries to focus on first, where should

298
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:21,820
I go first.
So now in the optimization tips sections,

299
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:25,679
you will get these localization insights that
will guide you in the process. They will tell

300
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,330
you whether you're missing anything. Maybe
you localized your APK, but you forgot to

301
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:33,330
localize your listing. And we'll also help
you identify opportunities. They, for example,

302
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:37,429
will tell you, you may have a lot of users
from Russia. Even though you never localized

303
00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:43,989
your app there, that's a great opportunity
that you should go into.

304
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:50,539
Which brings me to the next topic, which is
reaching Play global audience.

305
00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:56,909
When you decide to go -- oops, too bad. When
you decide to go global, the first and most

306
00:23:56,909 --> 00:24:01,669
important thing that you want to do is localize
your application contents. And many developers

307
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:04,629
are already doing that and expanding into
new markets.

308
00:24:04,629 --> 00:24:08,220
And as a non-native English speaker, as some
of you may have guessed from my funny accent

309
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:13,840
-- I'm Italian -- I think one of the most
important things is to make sure that your

310
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,519
app is available to as many users in as many
countries and as many languages as possible,

311
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:22,229
but still providing the same high-quality
experience that you would provide to users

312
00:24:22,229 --> 00:24:27,549
who speak your own language.
And we announced on Wednesday that now from

313
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:32,509
the Google Play Developer Console, you have
access to professional translations in collaboration

314
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:39,299
with the Google Translation Manager team.
Let me show you how this works.

315
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:44,059
So in the APK screen, at the very bottom,
there will be the recently used section, which

316
00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:48,759
is called the app translation that you can
use to start to request a professional translation.

317
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:53,090
Just click the button, starts a wizard that
will guide you through the process. You pick

318
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:58,639
a project name. That is just for your convenience.
Some of you may have multiple projects going

319
00:24:58,639 --> 00:25:05,169
on at any same time. Pick the version -- sorry,
the language you're translating from. You

320
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:09,119
then upload the strings. If you're using the
Android developer tools, you can use that

321
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:16,029
directly from the Eclipse plug-in. Otherwise,
you can just upload the XML files.

322
00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:23,029
Once that's done, you wait. Then you go, you
pick the languages you want to translate into.

323
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:27,320
I'm going to pick, I don't know, Japanese
and Korean. Those are just two markets that

324
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,669
you cannot be outside of.
You pick the service level. The service level

325
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:36,090
basically decides how many users, how many
people are actually looking at your strings

326
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:43,090
and contributing to the translation in a translation
company you pick. You get an idea of the price.

327
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,450
You choose the translation company you want
to use. You get an indication of how long

328
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:50,279
it's going to take and how much it's going
to cost. Obviously, the cost of the translation

329
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:56,039
depends on how many words you have in your
strings file.

330
00:25:56,039 --> 00:26:00,409
And then you get a confirmation page where
you can reorder and get started with your

331
00:26:00,409 --> 00:26:04,840
translation.
The moment you confirm that, the translation

332
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:09,200
company will start right away translating
your strings. And from the developer console,

333
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,409
you will be able to check progress. You will
be able to see how far (indiscernible) the

334
00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:17,419
translation is in translating all your content.
While they're doing their work, you will be

335
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:20,739
able to communicate with them, answer any
questions that might arise, troubleshooting,

336
00:26:20,739 --> 00:26:26,100
these kind of things. And then once all the
strings are done, you will be able to -- again,

337
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:32,330
from the developer console -- download them,
put them into your APK, pack everything, and

338
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:35,249
publish.
And this feature is rolling out in private

339
00:26:35,249 --> 00:26:38,970
beta, just like we did for the developer console
itself last year, which means that if you

340
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:44,119
go to the APK page right now, you will see
a sign-up form where you can see -- where

341
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:50,749
you can leave your contact details. And then
we will shortly start rolling this out to

342
00:26:50,749 --> 00:26:53,369
everybody.
I want to reinforce again the importance of

343
00:26:53,369 --> 00:26:57,940
reaching a global audience. I want to speak
for a few seconds about Gameloft. I think

344
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:02,590
all of you know who Gameloft is. They are
a successful games company. They are based

345
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:07,929
in Europe. They realized very early the importance
of targeting multiple languages and multiple

346
00:27:07,929 --> 00:27:13,269
locales. They're currently available to 12
languages: English, German, Italian, French,

347
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:18,830
Chinese, Japanese, and a few other European
and Asian languages. And they have (indiscernible)

348
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:23,389
experiences they want to share with you. One
is when they wanted to localize Ice Age Village

349
00:27:23,389 --> 00:27:28,539
to Russian. So Ice Age Village has a user
base of 10 million users. And they discovered

350
00:27:28,539 --> 00:27:33,940
that 14% of those users are actually Russian
users. That's the second biggest market after

351
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:38,909
English users.
Another case that they had is when they decided

352
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:43,869
to localize My Little Pony to Turkish. As
part of a global application update, they

353
00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:48,330
had the Turkish localization. And they discovered
very interesting figures. So the number of

354
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:55,330
active users in Turkey jumped up by 95% compared
to 20 to 25% that did in other countries.

355
00:27:55,989 --> 00:27:59,979
And that was thanks to the presence of localized
content rather than just a simple application

356
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:04,799
update.
The revenue jumped up by 600% in Turkey. And

357
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:09,519
the revenue per daily active users jumped
up by 300%.

358
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:14,049
Another tip that you might want to use that
I took advantage of, they used local holidays

359
00:28:14,049 --> 00:28:17,720
and other local knowledge to make promotions
and sales, like they did, for example, for

360
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:24,720
the Chinese New Year.
So let me stress it one more time: Think global.

361
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:28,190
Always aim to target a really global audience
in multiple countries and multiple languages.

362
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:32,450
I hope that this feature that we just announced
will help you do that easily. And if you want

363
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:36,720
to learn more, there's a session at noon,
I think, which is Building Android Apps for

364
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,299
a Global Audience, where you can learn more
on how this translation process works and

365
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:46,059
the details behind that.
Having said that, let me go back to Ellie.

366
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:52,269
>>Ellie Powers: All right. Thanks, Riccardo.
Today, we've given you an overview of everything

367
00:28:52,269 --> 00:28:56,229
we're bringing you to try to help you grow
your businesses across these three areas,

368
00:28:56,229 --> 00:29:00,499
first, publishing your app, having more control
over it, connecting directly with your user

369
00:29:00,499 --> 00:29:05,479
base. Secondly, gaining insight into your
users and what they're doing with your app.

370
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:09,700
And then expanding your app to grow your user
base into new markets.

371
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:13,840
So because there was a lot of stuff, we're
going to give you a quick summary of everything

372
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,379
that's new.
So, first of all, we have, of course, beta

373
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:20,840
testing and staged rollouts, which allows
you to get user feedback early in the process

374
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,759
and respond to it.
Secondly, we're giving you summaries and overviews

375
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:30,299
of user ratings and your revenues so that
you can check those stats at your fingertips

376
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:34,539
very easily.
Next, we're giving you tablet-specific screen

377
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:39,229
shots so you can show off your awesome tablet
layouts. And if your app isn't designed for

378
00:29:39,229 --> 00:29:43,109
tablets yet, we give you optimization tips
to help you make it that way.

379
00:29:43,109 --> 00:29:47,440
We're also helping you identify how to localize
your app and where you should go first with

380
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,720
new localization tips.
We also announced that everyone can now reply

381
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,629
to reviews.
But stay tuned, because there's a lot more

382
00:29:55,629 --> 00:30:00,369
coming this summer. So we have three new areas
where you should watch for some announcements

383
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:04,210
on the Android Developers Blog in the future.
First of all, we're going to be having those

384
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:09,090
extra access controls so you can grant more
people access to the developer console without

385
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:15,320
getting worried. We're also adding new Google
Analytics integration figures. So these were

386
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:20,409
the campaign referral tracking flows, that
conversion funnel, and also seeing your Google

387
00:30:20,409 --> 00:30:23,649
Analytics usage data directly in the developer
console.

388
00:30:23,649 --> 00:30:28,749
And, finally, if you're interested in translating
your app with our new App Translation Service,

389
00:30:28,749 --> 00:30:32,970
which is being offered in partnership with
our internationalization team, sign up today

390
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:37,159
in the developer console. It's at the bottom
of the APK page if you're looking for it.

391
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:42,070
Okay. So as I said at the beginning, everything
that we're doing is with you, Google Play

392
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:47,690
developers, in mind. And we need to keep getting
your feedback in order to plan our next 12

393
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:51,619
months and even farther in the future.
We hope you'll join us for office hours today

394
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:56,669
following this session. We hope that you also
rush right back after that, because at 12:00,

395
00:30:56,669 --> 00:31:00,440
there's a very important session on monetization.
And everyone is looking for more information

396
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,289
about money.
So if you're watching this session online

397
00:31:03,289 --> 00:31:06,979
and you missed the office hours, you want
to make sure that you're following Android

398
00:31:06,979 --> 00:31:11,450
developers on Google+, because that's the
best place to go to see new announcements

399
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:16,099
about what's happening in the world of Android
development. You can watch Hangouts. We always

400
00:31:16,099 --> 00:31:20,289
post our blog post there as well. And we go
and look for your feedback about what you're

401
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:25,499
looking to see on Google Play.
So that's it. And the next thing we're going

402
00:31:25,499 --> 00:31:30,389
to do now is start by taking some questions.
We have about eight minutes left. So if you'd

403
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:34,789
like to come to the microphone at the front,
or I think there may be possibly one there

404
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:38,299
as well, that will be great. We'll alternate
between the two microphones.

405
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:40,620
You in the red hat at the front, what would
you like to ask?

406
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:44,909
>>> Hi, Chuck Grove from AWeber Communications.
I actually have two really quick questions.

407
00:31:44,909 --> 00:31:51,289
I had a lot more, but I narrowed it down to
two. So with the new alpha/beta production

408
00:31:51,289 --> 00:31:56,399
system for launching a new version, is there
still a concept of draft APKs? And if so,

409
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:01,139
how does that relate to testing in-app billing?
>>Ellie Powers: Great question.

410
00:32:01,139 --> 00:32:05,779
>>Miles Barr: Can I take this one? Yes?
When you go to the advanced mode part of the

411
00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:10,409
tab, you can upload draft APKs. So that's
sort of still separate from alpha and beta

412
00:32:10,409 --> 00:32:16,200
testing. You can imagine the alpha and beta
tabs is exactly the same as production. And

413
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,979
the drafts are shared across all three sections.
Correct?

414
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:24,210
>>Riccardo Govoni: Yep.
>>Miles Barr: So they will have access to

415
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,899
in-app billing for testing purposes.
>>Riccardo Govoni: So specific for in-app

416
00:32:26,899 --> 00:32:32,479
billing, I think we still have a few improvements
to do. But from the in-app billing sandbox

417
00:32:32,479 --> 00:32:37,539
that was announced in these days, you can
both use the tester section and the developer

418
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:41,950
profile to decide testers that will have access,
for example, before in-app billing experience

419
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:46,499
without a link to actually pay. Or you can
use beta testing and then side loading that

420
00:32:46,499 --> 00:32:53,499
APK, for example, to do fake purchases.
>>> Okay. Thank you.

421
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,989
And then my other question was about the staged
rollouts for the actual listing. If you want

422
00:32:59,989 --> 00:33:04,149
to add some new screen shots, new description,
things like that, if you're doing a staged

423
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:07,149
rollout, is only the people who are getting
the update going to see the new listing or

424
00:33:07,149 --> 00:33:09,570
is everyone going to see it?
>>Riccardo Govoni: No. At the moment, there's

425
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:14,369
just still one listing. So you may want to
be -- you want to pay attention to that for

426
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:17,509
the moment, for the time being. So if you
put something in your store listing, for example,

427
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:21,950
a brand-new feature, and you're still rolled
out only to 5% of the users, you know, it

428
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:25,909
may be -- you have to communicate it publicly.
Maybe you say to say that we are rolling a

429
00:33:25,909 --> 00:33:30,109
new version, and that's the feature that they're
getting and they will be getting over the

430
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:32,460
next few days.
>>> So you say "for the time being." That

431
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,849
makes me hopeful about what's to company.
>>Riccardo Govoni: Yes.

432
00:33:34,849 --> 00:33:37,819
>>Ellie Powers: Always looking for feedback.
In the back, please.

433
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:41,149
>>> Hi. My name is Manford (saying name).
I have an interest in automating the whole

434
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:44,950
process of the deployment, how we're staging
and deployment.

435
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:50,559
Is there some sort of, like, plan towards
being allowed to, like, integrate on a continuous

436
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:55,269
integration server to automatically, as part
of, say, a nightly build with QA tests that

437
00:33:55,269 --> 00:34:00,429
are automated, push it out to a staged environment
automatically? I mean, at the moment, I'm

438
00:34:00,429 --> 00:34:05,609
doing with Selenium, but that's a hack; right?
So is there some sort of plan to, like, have

439
00:34:05,609 --> 00:34:07,669
an API maybe so it could even be integrated
in build tools?

440
00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:09,050
>>Ellie Powers: Would you like --

441
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:15,950
>>Ellie Powers: Yeah! All right. We totally
heard you. This has been a super popular developer

442
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:20,260
request; right? Everyone's got their own system,
and we're really excited with the beta testing

443
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:23,849
that more and more people want to be pushing
their APKs even more often.

444
00:34:23,849 --> 00:34:27,770
So I guess, you know, we won't say too much
about the future. But we definitely will say

445
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:31,500
that we've heard that, we're thinking about
it, and, you know, as soon as we have anything

446
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,919
to share, we'll definitely let you know. But
we definitely hear you on that one. That's

447
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:39,139
a very common request that we get.
>>> Thank you.

448
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:43,369
>>> So in the Play Store, you guys added the
design for tablets feature because you recognize

449
00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:46,760
that phones and tablets are fundamentally
different in their apps.

450
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:51,230
With more smart Glass products coming out,
is that going to be extensible to other types

451
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:54,960
of products? And if one were to manufacture
such a product, how would they engage with

452
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,770
you guys to make sure that that feature would
happen and set the criterias and all that

453
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:02,710
kind of stuff?
>>Ellie Powers: All right. Take this one?

454
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:07,029
>>Miles Barr: It's a good one.
So right now we're only sort of focusing on

455
00:35:07,029 --> 00:35:12,569
tablets. But we're aware, you know, within
our own team -- well, our team and externally,

456
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:16,160
lots of different form factors that are coming
out. So, you know, when you think of things

457
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:22,900
like Google TV, it's something we consider.
I think we want to wait for a particular device

458
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:28,309
class to sort of take off or begin to get
a foothold before we change the store. But

459
00:35:28,309 --> 00:35:31,779
definitely other form factors is something
we would consider.

460
00:35:31,779 --> 00:35:34,559
>>> Okay. Thank you.
>>Ellie Powers: All right.

461
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:40,900
>>> I have a question about the device distribution
of my app in the Play Store.

462
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:45,289
So when I see, like, the top ten devices where
my app is doing good. But what are the top

463
00:35:45,289 --> 00:35:49,640
ten devices on an aggregated level in the
Play Store? That I don't know. And it might

464
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:55,380
be the case that the top app -- device on
my app might be fifth in the global stack

465
00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:01,099
ranking and I might be leaving a lot of money
on the table because my app really doesn't

466
00:36:01,099 --> 00:36:06,460
do well on the top devices on a global ranking.
Is there any way I can get access to that

467
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:10,500
data?
>>Miles Barr: So short answer, no. But the

468
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,970
aim is that you shouldn't be focusing on particular
types of devices. You should be making sure

469
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:20,059
your app works across all devices, you know,
in the same great experience. So don't worry

470
00:36:20,059 --> 00:36:26,440
too much about specific devices. Try, you
know, to use a beta testing feature. Try to

471
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,950
reach more users on different devices to make
sure it works well.

472
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:32,260
You know, if you're doing some really sort
of cutting-edge stuff, we've seen people,

473
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:37,420
you know, really push the boundaries of 3D,
and sometimes that causes problems. You know,

474
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:41,430
you can look at the crash reports section
in particular to find out if there's a problem

475
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:46,339
device and how best to fix on it.
But definitely don't try to optimize your

476
00:36:46,339 --> 00:36:53,339
app for a specific set of devices. You know,
make sure it's a great experience for everyone.

477
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,010
>>> Thank you.
>>> John (saying name) with RadarNow! USNaviguide.

478
00:36:56,010 --> 00:37:01,319
I have some APKs in my developer console that
are years old and essentially abandoned. And

479
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:05,819
now with the rollout of the beta feature,
I'm going to have all these beta versions

480
00:37:05,819 --> 00:37:10,130
of our apps stuck out there. Is there going
to be a feature to archive or delete, you

481
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:14,400
know, old and abandoned APKs?
>>Ellie Powers: Yeah, this is also a very

482
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,690
popular request. I saw some applause over
there.

483
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:22,000
So it depends. So right now, many of you may
not know this, but if you have not published

484
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,910
an app, you can delete it today. Yeah.
So if you go to the developer console, on

485
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:32,630
the right-hand side, there's a little, I don't
know, gray button, and you can select "delete."

486
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,200
>>> Well, these are, like, apps that --
>>Ellie Powers: I know. If you've published

487
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,480
them, I totally hear you on that. I see a
lot of feedback. It's definitely in the top

488
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,630
ten things that we're seeing coming in with
the feedback. So we hear you on that.

489
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:46,130
I guess with the alpha and beta, just to be
really clear, those are in the same store

490
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:49,849
listing, so it's not going to litter up your
app page anymore. But we definitely hear folks

491
00:37:49,849 --> 00:37:54,240
who have apps that they don't work on anymore,
and they kind of want to hide that. So we're

492
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,220
definitely looking into that possibility.
>>> Well, I have beta versions for testing.

493
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:00,160
And now --
>>Ellie Powers: Okay. With different package

494
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:00,980
names.
>>> Yes. Yeah.

495
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:04,539
>>Ellie Powers: Okay. I see. Yeah, we have
definitely heard that. I guess we're not announcing

496
00:38:04,539 --> 00:38:07,950
any changes today that are happening there.
But we've definitely heard that as a top ten

497
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:08,910
request.
>>> Thanks very much.

498
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:12,339
>>Riccardo Govoni: Is that just something
that you would like to hide from the applications

499
00:38:12,339 --> 00:38:14,380
list?
>>> Yeah. It would be okay if we could just

500
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:18,799
archive them so they're not sticking there
right in our face every time we go in. You

501
00:38:18,799 --> 00:38:23,170
know, I mean, sometimes also it would be good
to order, be able to order the list so that

502
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:27,809
the ones that we're using and that are popular
at the top instead of, I don't know exactly,

503
00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:31,640
you might have it alphabetically now or something.
>>Miles Barr: I think it's alphabet, yeah.

504
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,529
>>> But archiving, just archive, you know,
hide or something.

505
00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:37,710
>>Ellie Powers: Yeah, a lot of folks have
wanted to hide the unpublished ones, like,

506
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:41,109
once they're not using it anymore, to hide
them. So we definitely have heard that one.

507
00:38:41,109 --> 00:38:45,520
>>> Great. Thanks very much.
Oh, I love the comments thing, by the way.

508
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,170
I've had it for a year. It's great.
>>Ellie Powers: Oh, yeah? Awesome. I'm glad.

509
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:51,510
The back.
>>> Hi. My question is about staged rollouts

510
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:55,740
and how do you determine which percentage
of users is it? And is it the same percentage

511
00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:00,770
of users each time or is it different? So
when you release new versions of the app,

512
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:03,299
is it always going to be that same 10% that
you're going to be --

513
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:09,430
>>Riccardo Govoni: So --
>>Miles Barr: So it's random per staged rollout.

514
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:14,250
So by that, so when you're rolling out a new
version, we sort of have a different random

515
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:20,289
seed to select which 10%. But we keep that
seed during that rollout process. So if you

516
00:39:20,289 --> 00:39:25,240
don't want to push that out to 100%, you want
to place it in another APK. Those original

517
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,650
10% will get the update.
>>> So you can have, then, 2 -- like, you

518
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:34,410
can have a 2.0 to everyone, a 2.1 to 10%,
and a then 2.2 to a different 10%? Is that

519
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:35,880
possible?
>>Miles Barr: No. There's only one staged

520
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,539
rollout at any time.
>>Riccardo Govoni: So anytime you do a staged

521
00:39:38,539 --> 00:39:42,260
rollout, we pick a different part of the population.
So, you know, it's not the same guys that

522
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:46,950
get the same testing APK stack. But during
a staged rollout, if you decide that the particular

523
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:51,170
APK needs changing, then you can change it
and the same group of users will receive that.

524
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:53,890
>>> Okay. Great. Thank you.
>>Miles Barr: And also, to clarify, staged

525
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:55,640
rollouts, not for testing.
>>> Yeah. Sorry.

526
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,940
>>> Okay.
>>Miles Barr: Only staged rollout when you're

527
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:00,510
ready for everyone to get it.
>>Ellie Powers: All right. So it looks like

528
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:04,650
we basically have five seconds left. But don't
worry. I still see some folks wanting to ask

529
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:07,740
questions. We're just going to head back to
office hours. And don't forget that there's

530
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:12,190
a monetization section here in an hour, or
