1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,440
DON DODGE: We have a great panel
today to help us answer

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,800
some of these questions.

4
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,470
First, Jessica Livingston.

5
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,240
Jessica started in investment
banking and then was a

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,890
co-founder of Y Combinator,
and has written a book--

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,030
several books, I think-- but the
one that I read, "Founders

8
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:27,450
at Work." And Paul Graham, the
other founder of Y Combinator,

9
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,250
made one of the best decisions
in his life when he proposed

10
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,210
to marry Jessica.

11
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,360
So they're husband and wife.

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,500
Next to Jessica,
Naval Ravikant.

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,170
Naval is the founder
of Angel List.

14
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,500
I'm sure you all know
about Angel List.

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,780
But he's also an entrepreneur
before that.

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,120
He co-founded several companies
before that--

17
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,690
Genoa, Epinions.

18
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,740
You probably have heard
of Epinions.

19
00:00:54,740 --> 00:01:01,680
And he's also a co-author
of "Venture Hacks."

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,240
And next to Naval, Heidi Roizen,
a longtime friend.

21
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,780
Heidi is also an entrepreneur
and founder.

22
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,320
She co-founded T/Maker
back in the PC era.

23
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,800
And she was a venture capitalist
at SoftBank, one of

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,710
the hottest venture capital
firms at the time, and is now

25
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,650
at Draper Fisher Jurvetson,
and she's also

26
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,380
a lecturer at Stanford.

27
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,210
So very accomplished panel.

28
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:35,470
So the way we run this, this
session is for you.

29
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:39,560
So there are two mics here, and
we want you to come up and

30
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,940
ask questions throughout.

31
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,600
So I'm going to start with
some questions to get it

32
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,980
going, but at any point, come up
to the mic, I'll recognize

33
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,500
you, and you can ask
your question.

34
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,460
Typically, over half
of this session is

35
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,120
questions from the audience.

36
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,680
So start thinking about your
questions, line up at the mic,

37
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,750
and we'll get as
many as we can.

38
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,220
I'll start with a few
questions here.

39
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:11,050
So Jessica, Y Combinator, it's
the first and largest

40
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,630
incubator ever.

41
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:20,110
How many companies apply to Y
Combinator now, and how many

42
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,360
do you accept?

43
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,290

44
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,400
JESSICA LIVINGSTON:
Can you hear me?

45
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,030
Lately, like the last
application process we had for

46
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:35,460
the summer batch, I think we got
about 2,500 applications,

47
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:40,180
and this summer's batch
is 52 startups.

48
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,040
DON DODGE: 52 out of 2,500.

49
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,140
JESSICA LIVINGSTON: Out
of 2,500, yeah.

50
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,250
DON DODGE: So that's like 2%.

51
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,660
JESSICA LIVINGSTON:
It's pretty low.

52
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,710
DON DODGE: Cool.

53
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:53,870
That's harder than Harvard
to get into Y Combinator.

54
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,370
Probably better, too.

55
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,940

56
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,200
How do you decide which
companies to accept?

57
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,830
JESSICA LIVINGSTON: Well we have
10-minute interviews, so

58
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,380
it's a big challenge to
choose the startups.

59
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,080
And for those of you who don't
know, we conduct the

60
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,610
interviews back to back all day
long, and then we contact

61
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:18,150
the founders that night to say
whether we'd like to fund them

62
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,850
or not, so they find
out that very day.

63
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:24,560
So in the 10 minutes,
what do we do?

64
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,610
We have three different tracks
of Y Combinator partners doing

65
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,360
the interviews.

66
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,560
So I'm in a room with Paul and
Robert and Trevor, the

67
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,360
original founders, and they're
all technical.

68
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,070
I'm not technical.

69
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:42,490
And so I let them evaluate the
technology and evaluate

70
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:46,830
whether the founders are good at
programming, which is very

71
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,580
hard to tell.

72
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,580
But you can sometimes base it
on what they've built if

73
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,970
they've built something already,
or if they, in their

74
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,690
application, have built
something in the past, we take

75
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:00,710
a long look at that in the
application process.

76
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,440
What I am looking at
specifically in interviews, I

77
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,460
sort of block out all the other
stuff and I'm looking at

78
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:12,130
the co-founder dynamic and the
personalities of the founders.

79
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:17,390
Have they thought deeply about
what their startup idea, the

80
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,110
area that it's in?

81
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:23,550
Do they seem excited about
it, believe it or not?

82
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,370
Do they get along?

83
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,680
Are they interrupting
each other?

84
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,440
That's a bad sign.

85
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,460
Different things like that.

86
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,110
It's sort of hard to describe.

87
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,180
And then literally after the
10 minutes, the four of us

88
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,430
say, OK, should we
fund them or not?

89
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,450
And sometimes it's very clear
and we all say absolutely

90
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,910
because we're excited about
the idea and the people.

91
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,520
Sometimes we have to talk about
it for a few minutes,

92
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,510
but it's never more than
a few minutes.

93
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,940
DON DODGE: So in 10 minutes, you
can decide whether this is

94
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,710
a company you're going
to invest in or not.

95
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,070
JESSICA LIVINGSTON: Yeah.

96
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:56,550
It seems pretty crazy, and
sometimes we're wrong.

97
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,880
But when we first started Y
Combinator in 2005, we had

98
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,050
half an hour interviews.

99
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,850
Of course, we were only
interviewing 25 startups at

100
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:05,530
that point.

101
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,120
But we realized that we really
did have a sense after the

102
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,040
first few minutes and a lot
of the time was wasted.

103
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,280
So we make it 10 minutes so we
can talk to more groups.

104
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,000
DON DODGE: Cool.

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,410
So Heidi, you're in the venture
capital business and

106
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,190
you fund companies.

107
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:25,060
How do you decide who to fund
and who not to fund?

108
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,440
HEIDI ROIZEN: Well, a lot of the
work gets done before we

109
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,000
ever meet face to face because
I think for every venture

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,780
capital firm, there are areas
that we are knowledgeable in

111
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,220
and there are areas we're
not knowledgeable in.

112
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,240
It doesn't make a lot of sense
for us to try to make an

113
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,640
investment in an area that we
don't know anything about.

114
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,330
I think that's pretty true
of most venture firms.

115
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:46,020
They'll pick practice areas that
they're interested in.

116
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,570
We look at a lot of deals
that come in.

117
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,470
We get together every Monday,
the partners, and we discuss

118
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,450
things that we've seen or things
we've heard about.

119
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,370
Obviously, we're batting things
around on email a lot.

120
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,480
If you think about when we're
in a partner meeting,

121
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:04,150
collectively among us, we sit
on close to 100 boards, so

122
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,580
it's a very interesting group
of people because we're in

123
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,810
there with about 100 company
data points in real time in

124
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,480
our heads, presuming we're
paying attention to the

125
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,990
companies we're actually already
invested in, which

126
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,550
isn't always true of all VCs.

127
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,890
But we have a lot
of data points.

128
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:24,720
And so part of looking at
funding-- and by the way, I

129
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,510
was an entrepreneur.

130
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:30,230
I spent six months on the road
my first time out trying to

131
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,700
raise money.

132
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,300
No one would fund us.

133
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,900
We self-funded, we
bootstrappped, and we funded

134
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:39,780
in my very most favorite way to
be funded way, which is not

135
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,070
represented by any of us up
here, which is we actually got

136
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,890
customers to buy our product.

137
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:46,300
It's this really cool way to
get funding because it's

138
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:51,610
non-dilutive and you learn
something and it validates

139
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,710
your business proposition.

140
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,540
So it's cool at many levels,
and that's how we did it.

141
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,990
And so we only raised our first
round six years after we

142
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,710
started the company, and we were
already about $4 million

143
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,630
in revenue and profitable when
we did, which really changes

144
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:10,170
your dynamics in terms of what
you can negotiate with.

145
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:14,300
So I give you all that to say,
I've been on your side of the

146
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,560
table, and I've been on
my side of the table.

147
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,920
I've been on both sides the
table and it is a relatively

148
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,890
random process.

149
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,280
So if you're sitting there
thinking, this sounds

150
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,440
ridiculous.

151
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,320
How could you possibly make a
decision in 10 minutes, which

152
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,210
I completely agree.

153
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:29,990
We do the same thing.

154
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,830
How could you read a one pager
and know whether you're going

155
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,150
to invest or not?

156
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:33,620
I don't know.

157
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,900
It's a pretty crazy system,
but that's how the vast

158
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,860
majority of the venture
capitalists I know do it.

159
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,500
It's a lot about gut and feel
and pattern recognition and

160
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,510
pattern and sensing something
about the team and the mission

161
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,610
they're on, and it's very hard
to articulate, which is why

162
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:53,960
also venture is very much a
small team, a business.

163
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:59,130
It's also why you'll take 50
meetings and you'll get 50

164
00:07:59,130 --> 00:07:59,910
different answers.

165
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:03,150
And when you ask VCs for
feedback, you'll get

166
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:07,460
diametrically opposed views,
and that doesn't matter.

167
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,310
You just go out and kiss
a bunch of frogs, and

168
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,960
eventually, you will
find one, I think.

169
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,160
If you believe in your idea and
you've got a good idea,

170
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,620
you will find one.

171
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,070
But it is a lengthy process
and don't think that the

172
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,490
people on the other side of the
table from you have some

173
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,690
magic thing.

174
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,930
And I'll just close
by saying this.

175
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:26,800
I know some VCs who've tried
over time to quantify this.

176
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,710
In fact, I know this big
initiative going on that one

177
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:31,440
person's doing who's super smart
and is trying to do this

178
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,330
thing about, if you have these
degrees from these places and

179
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:38,850
you worked at these places, and
in fact, if you dropped

180
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,110
out before you finish-- because
that's the current

181
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,510
lore is it's better to drop out
from Harvard or Stanford

182
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,940
than it is to actually finish
in any one of those places.

183
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:50,230
So he's actually trying to do
this analysis and say, can I

184
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,380
figure out which ones
are going to be the

185
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,900
best based on analysis?

186
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,230
And just so far, every
one of those

187
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,090
initiatives has largely failed.

188
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:01,050
So it really is all about
reading, being able to get

189
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,000
your point across well enough
that you intrigue someone

190
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,920
enough to take that
first meeting.

191
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,720
It's not about getting all the
way to the finish line.

192
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,870
It's about intriguing us enough
so we'll take the

193
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,080
meeting, and then it's about
knowing how to make that 10

194
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,330
minutes really count.

195
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:14,780
DON DODGE: Right.

196
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,270
We have questions
in the audience.

197
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,150
Let's start here.

198
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:17,300
AUDIENCE: Hi.

199
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,640
It's a great panel.

200
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,410
I was recently at a meeting of
VCs where I met somebody who

201
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:29,030
sort of criticized the idea of
all these different startup

202
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,900
incubators coming up.

203
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,940
He though, well, they're forced
into a three-month

204
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,870
program, and at the end of the
time, they have to show that

205
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:41,230
they're on a hockey stick sort
of curve in terms of the

206
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:44,670
revenue, and if they don't
do it, then that's it.

207
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,590
You don't really get anywhere.

208
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:50,470
So his criticism was that
these incubators force

209
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:54,040
businesses to sort of develop
a certain way, and he didn't

210
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,230
think that was good.

211
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,980
So I was wondering what your
thoughts are on the whole idea

212
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,450
of all these different
incubators

213
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:02,304
coming up in general.

214
00:10:02,304 --> 00:10:04,420
JESSICA LIVINGSTON: I assume
that's for me.

215
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,440
Well, when we started Y
Combinator, I can promise you

216
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,170
we did not expect there
to be so many people

217
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,990
doing what we do.

218
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,950
So I don't know.

219
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:16,630
I don't really have a comment
on if it's good or bad.

220
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:22,690
But in terms of our startups,
over this three month period,

221
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,030
we're working very closely with
them to help prepare them

222
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,580
for Demo Day, which is when
there's a room filled with

223
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:32,020
investors, 400 investors, to
come and see their two and a

224
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,910
half minute pitches.

225
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:36,340
And again, the goal is to just
create an interest and

226
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,630
hopefully get a meeting.

227
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,890
And we think that that's a great
idea because it's such

228
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,940
an efficient way for investors
to spend a couple hours of

229
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,810
their time and see 40 or
50 companies at once.

230
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,110
It's great if there's a
hockey stick curve.

231
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,310
It's great if after three
months, you have this major

232
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,890
growth rate because investors
love that.

233
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,700
But it's certainly not true
for everyone, and it's

234
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,390
certainly not true that every
single startup raises tons of

235
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,500
money right after Demo Day.

236
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,185
Some of them raise Series A,
some of them raise a few

237
00:11:09,185 --> 00:11:11,450
hundred thousand dollars and
get back to working on the

238
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:15,480
product, and then six months
to a year later, we'll help

239
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,190
them go out and they'll
raise funding then.

240
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:23,290
AUDIENCE: So do you think having
all these incubators is

241
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,100
a good thing?

242
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,610
NAVAL RAVIKANT: So the
accelerators are there--

243
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,818
I actually don't like calling
them incubators, so I'm just

244
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:30,380
going to switch the terminology
if someone doesn't

245
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,040
mind, because they're not really
incubating little eggs

246
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,950
and hatching them.

247
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,750
I just find that's like a
demeaning nomenclature.

248
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,300
The accelerators serve three
incredibly important

249
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,350
functions, just like schools
do, just like MIT does or

250
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:42,910
Harvard does.

251
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,770
One is they filter.

252
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,692
So they help go through all the
noise and say, these are

253
00:11:45,692 --> 00:11:47,590
the people worth looking at
before they might have a

254
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,500
product or before they
might have traction.

255
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,460
So that 10 minute interview
that Jessica and Paul and

256
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,190
Robert and Trevor do, people pay
enormous amounts of money

257
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,420
for the output from those 10
minute interviews, so that's

258
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,870
very important function.

259
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,670
The second thing that the
accelerators do is they do the

260
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,590
education function.

261
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,440
Part of that might be, look,
here's how you raise money.

262
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,825
That's kind of an obvious
question people

263
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:05,880
are going to ask.

264
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,860
And the third thing they do is
they build an incredible

265
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,210
alumni network that pulls
resources, educates the

266
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,540
entrepreneurs, unionizes their
power a little bit, and

267
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,600
standardizes the things that
they might have had to do one

268
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,870
off or ad hoc.

269
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:19,730
So these are very valuable
functions, and without the

270
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:20,890
accelerators today,
I don't think the

271
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:21,620
angels could function.

272
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,300
There would be too may deals out
there to look at, and they

273
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,990
wouldn't know what to look
at and what not to.

274
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,470
And without the angels out
there, I don't think the VCs

275
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,370
could function.

276
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:30,165
The VCs are using the angels
for signals, and the angels

277
00:12:30,165 --> 00:12:32,110
are using the accelerators
for signals.

278
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,410
So like it or not, they're a
part of the ecosystem that's

279
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:35,440
here to stay.

280
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,880
But just like there are lots of
angels and there are good

281
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,000
ones and bad ones, and just like
there are lots of VCs and

282
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,690
there are successful ones and
failed ones, there are lots of

283
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:44,100
accelerators, and there's the
cream of the crop, and there's

284
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,560
the not so good.

285
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,700
So they're an important part of
infrastructure that's not

286
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,820
going away.

287
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,570
I would say that today, probably
half of the companies

288
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,320
that we feature on Angel List
have come through some

289
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,100
accelerator or another, and we
count that signal in as to

290
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,310
which accelerator they came
from and who they got

291
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:04,870
associated from that accelerator
and what kind of

292
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,240
financing they did afterwards
as an input signal.

293
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,360
Everyone in this business is
looking at tons of noise and

294
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,840
trying to extract signals.

295
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,450
And it is through that
pattern matching.

296
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,230
And to the point earlier, you
cannot systematize that.

297
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:19,060
You can't automate it.

298
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,720
Think about the combinatorics
of human DNA.

299
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,750
There's six billion, seven
billion people on this planet.

300
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,300
No two are even vaguely
similar if

301
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,350
you get to know them.

302
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,760
And companies at this stage
are just combinations of

303
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,090
individuals, so they're
even more unique.

304
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:33,670
So you need all these human
filters who are constantly

305
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,930
quickly assessing everyone to
figure out who gets to make it

306
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:37,960
to the next stage.

307
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,270
Like it or not, that's
the way it works.

308
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,630
HEIDI ROIZEN: I want to add one
thing because I've heard

309
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,060
that same thing.

310
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,710
If you tell people that they
have to solve a problem with

311
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,450
three months and $50,000, you're
only going to solve

312
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,760
easy problems, is
the complaint.

313
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,080
And number one, I'm a huge fan
of accelerators and of angel

314
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,280
financing because I think
that they do fill--

315
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,460
yes, there are problems you can
actually solve in three

316
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,080
months with $50,000, but there
are also problems you can kind

317
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,850
of take your first whack at it
with three months and $50,000

318
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:12,460
and show progression, even if
it's not user metrics because

319
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,380
you don't get there.

320
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,920
At the other end of the
spectrum, there are things,

321
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,120
like I know Singularity is
trying to mount something

322
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,870
where they're trying to solve
really big problems.

323
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,180
They're trying to stake out the
area where they say, we're

324
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,290
actually going to be the
accelerator that solves really

325
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,300
big problems that take
a long time.

326
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,670
The problem with really big
problems that take a long time

327
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:32,330
is the funding mechanisms of
both, I think accelerators and

328
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:37,250
angel investors, they're not
life cycle financing for

329
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,520
really big problems, which is
why you have a whole food

330
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:44,000
chain of people, including
venture capitalists, all the

331
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,880
way up through investment
bankers and ultimately the

332
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,550
public markets-- which there
are periods of time where

333
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:54,250
public markets actually allow
non-profitable companies to go

334
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,030
public, which is another
way of getting funding.

335
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,100
So I think there's that whole
food chain there.

336
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,980
I think you have to know--

337
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,640
and this is a really important
thing for everybody, not just

338
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,910
for accelerator or angels
or whatever--

339
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:08,800
you have to know what you're
trying to do and what kind of

340
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,630
financing is appropriate for
you, because you can bang your

341
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,810
head against the wall all day
going to people who are just

342
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,700
the wrong people to fund you.

343
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,920
And people often will take
meetings, especially if you've

344
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,650
got something interesting,
because they like to get

345
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,450
educated, and you do not want
to spend all your time

346
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,440
educating the population.

347
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,920
So it's important to
understand that.

348
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,120
I do want to say there's
a really great book.

349
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,620
It is about venture financing,
but it also covers the other

350
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,100
areas, by these two guys, Brad
Feld and Jason Mendelson, who

351
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,960
are partners at Foundry Group,
and it's called "Venture

352
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,760
Deals, How to be Smarter Than
Your Venture Capitalist," or

353
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,340
something like that.

354
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,310
And actually, it does a really
nice job laying out the

355
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:50,320
landscape of financing and how
financing works, which I think

356
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,050
is super critical.

357
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,830
If you're going to take money
from anyone, you should know

358
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,680
what the whole end to
end life cycle looks

359
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,343
like for outside capital.

360
00:15:57,343 --> 00:15:58,030
DON DODGE: OK, great.

361
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,860
We have to on to the
next question.

362
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,010
AUDIENCE: All right.

363
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:01,780
My name's Jake.

364
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,660
I'm from Fargo, North Dakota.

365
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,405
Fargo's a lot different
than California.

366
00:16:05,405 --> 00:16:08,960

367
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,830
HEIDI ROIZEN: I was on the board
at Great Plains for five

368
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,570
years, so I've been to Fargo
many, many times.

369
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,600
AUDIENCE: And you know
Doug then, I suppose.

370
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,150
So we only have one venture
capitalist group in all of

371
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,970
North Dakota that I know of, I
believe, and they're in Fargo.

372
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,150
When I was 20, I started
a company doing mobile

373
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,800
development, all the
way through 23

374
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,270
now, still doing that.

375
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:28,460
But we did it one of those
unique ways where we didn't

376
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,340
raise money, we just built a
company that sold stuff and

377
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,140
made money.

378
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,480
And one of the things I did
realize, though, is I always

379
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,590
thought venture capital is a bad
idea, this is a bad idea.

380
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,460
But I realized that there are
problems that we'd like to

381
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,720
solve that are bigger than what
we have for resources.

382
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,450
And so in Fargo, those guys are
doing some of that, but

383
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:50,010
how do we inspire the idea
of venture capitalism--

384
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,260
there's some angel,
but it's totally

385
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:52,880
different than out here.

386
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,560
How do we bring that to Fargo?

387
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,800
And if not that right now, how
can people who are where we're

388
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,900
at work with you guys to
build something great?

389
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,560
NAVAL RAVIKANT: Well first,
you've got to make a lot of

390
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,430
money, get rich and then spend
it in North Dakota.

391
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,460
AUDIENCE: Working on it.

392
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,060
NAVAL RAVIKANT: Or you need to
make so much money that your

393
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,500
neighbors get jealous and then
want to invest in startups.

394
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,430
That's kind of how it works.

395
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,430
So if you look at Estonia,
it's a small country that

396
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:20,500
punches outside of its weight
in the startup industry

397
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,260
because they had Skype there
nearby, and so they have a lot

398
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,109
of ex-Skype people who are
investing into the ecosystem,

399
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:28,830
and they have accelerators, and
they have angel financing,

400
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,710
and they have venture
financing.

401
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,450
All of a sudden, you have all
these cool companies coming

402
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,290
out of this tiny little country
in the Baltics.

403
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:37,430
So I think it's just success
begets success.

404
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,820
The world is flattening
a little bit.

405
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,020
It's not flattening as much or
as quickly as we would like.

406
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,010
Angel List, we can be helpful,
but frankly, the bar is higher

407
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,080
if you're outside of Silicon
Valley or New York.

408
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,790
You've got to show a
lot more traction.

409
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,760
It's a rare venture capitalist
who's going to get on a plane

410
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,210
to fly to North Dakota.

411
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,900
I always though capital
was liquid--

412
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,680
AUDIENCE: If he was smart,
he would go there.

413
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,880
NAVAL RAVIKANT: By the way,
North Dakota is having its own

414
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,680
venture capital boom, it's just
around energy and shale.

415
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,020
But I always thought capital
was very liquid.

416
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,300
It turned out capital is liquid,
capitalists are not.

417
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,140
So capitalists don't like
to get on planes, and

418
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:09,730
they don't have to.

419
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,150
They're rich by definition.

420
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,980
So you've got to get on a plane,
you've got to come

421
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,060
here, you've got to open a
satellite office, you've got

422
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,120
to network a little bit.

423
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,030
You've got to use every resource
at your disposal

424
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,890
including Angel List, including
YC, including

425
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,460
whatever you can get to.

426
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:25,020
And I would say 10 years ago, it
was nearly impossible, with

427
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,290
the occasional exception,
to raise money

428
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,790
outside of Silicon Valley.

429
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:29,670
That's changing.

430
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:32,360
So now it's probably about
half the activity is in

431
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,080
Silicon Valley and maybe
half is spread out over

432
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,400
the rest of the world.

433
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,350
So that's a lot better than it
used to be, and that's thanks

434
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,100
to the internet, that great
equalizer that brings us all

435
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,500
here today.

436
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:41,955
DON DODGE: Great.

437
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:42,410
Thank you.

438
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,230
Next question.

439
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,020
AUDIENCE: Hi.

440
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,440
My name's Billy and I have
a question of all of you,

441
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,570
especially for Jessica.

442
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:53,330
I watched videos of you in Y
Combinator last year where you

443
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:58,750
talked about the Pokemon monster
for the startups.

444
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,100
DON DODGE: Pokemon--

445
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:00,985
AUDIENCE: The monster
for the startup.

446
00:19:00,985 --> 00:19:01,830
JESSICA LIVINGSTON: Do
you mean my talk

447
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:04,000
on what goes wrong?

448
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,740
AUDIENCE: No.

449
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,950
You talked about all the
challenges for the startups in

450
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,910
the YC class last year.

451
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:12,040

452
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,950
JESSICA LIVINGSTON: Yeah,
[? Mino ?] monsters?

453
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,200
AUDIENCE: It doesn't matter.

454
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,670

455
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:23,140
So my question is for you, one
of the challenges for all the

456
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:27,680
people who want to start up here
is a lot of us are on H1B

457
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,950
visa, and I know a lot
of talented people.

458
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:34,030
They are very highly
motivated.

459
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:36,720
But because of the constraints
of the startup visa, they

460
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,320
cannot go out and start
their own company.

461
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:44,170
So I want to know, how does
the startup community in

462
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:46,890
Silicon Valley deal with
this, and how much the

463
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,570
progress are we making?

464
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,870
And if we cannot make any
progress in the short term, do

465
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:58,380
you have any advice for anyone
on H1B visa but want to go out

466
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,270
and start their own company?

467
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:00,370
So

468
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,900
JESSICA LIVINGSTON: Just so I
make sure I understand your

469
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,580
question, it has to do with
immigration rules and how hard

470
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,850
it is to come here and
start a startup?

471
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:11,920
I know a lot of people care very
much about this topic.

472
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,670
AUDIENCE: And how do we
make progress on this?

473
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,950
JESSICA LIVINGSTON: People,
I promise you-- not me

474
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,510
particularly, even though I
worry about it a lot because a

475
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,070
lot of the people we fund are
from other countries--

476
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:26,770
but I know that a lot of heavy
hitters in Silicon Valley are

477
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:30,920
spending a lot of time trying to
make changes with the visas

478
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,860
and that sort of thing.

479
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:36,650
What I've noticed from the
people we funded, they can

480
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:41,110
come to Y Combinator for three
months, but it's very

481
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,800
difficult because they'll have
to fly back right before Demo

482
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,770
Day and they might not get back
into the country, and I

483
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,740
know it's very difficult and
challenging for them.

484
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,890
AUDIENCE: I'm talking about the
people who are in Silicon

485
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,150
Valley or residing
in the US here.

486
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,300
JESSICA LIVINGSTON: OK, I'm--

487
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,460
AUDIENCE: Still on the H1B,
because of the H1B visa

488
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,720
constraints, they cannot
go out there and

489
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,790
start their own company.

490
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,440
JESSICA LIVINGSTON: They can't
start a startup because

491
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,565
you're on an H1B?

492
00:20:59,565 --> 00:21:00,400
AUDIENCE: Yes, exactly.

493
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,560
JESSICA LIVINGSTON: Maybe try
to get a different visa?

494
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,950
An O1?

495
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,150
DON DODGE: There are other
ways to do it.

496
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:06,760
JESSICA LIVINGSTON: There
are other ways.

497
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,940
I mean honestly, I'm probably
not the best person to give

498
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,630
advice on that.

499
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:12,510
I would talk to either other
people who have started

500
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:16,130
startups and have gotten
different visas or an

501
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,640
immigration lawyer.

502
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,660
DON DODGE: So Steve Case,
the founder of AOL,

503
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,840
is working on this.

504
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,050
Ron Conway is working on it.

505
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,670
Google is working on it.

506
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:27,270
We're trying really hard to
solve this problem, but it's

507
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,120
not an easy one.

508
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,310
It's going to take
a little time.

509
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,370
But believe me, people are
working hard to fix it.

510
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,720
HEIDI ROIZEN: One way to stay in
the country is get accepted

511
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,410
into a Ph.D. program
somewhere.

512
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,480
I'm serious.

513
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,750
Get accepted into
a Ph.D. program.

514
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,000
AUDIENCE: My other point would
be apply for Startup Chile and

515
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,252
get $40,000.

516
00:21:44,252 --> 00:21:47,310
They give you the visa
on top of it.

517
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:50,180
DON DODGE: If you want to
go Chile, that's great.

518
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,430
Next question.

519
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,980

520
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,150
AUDIENCE: It struck me as funny
what you said about

521
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,650
dropping out of school.

522
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,950
What are your views
towards education?

523
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:05,460
I mean, if I were a 10-year-old
boy who wanted to

524
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:11,120
be an entrepreneur when I'm an
adult, what you think I should

525
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,760
be learning to become
an entrepreneur?

526
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,220
What would be a university
program to become an

527
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,750
entrepreneur?

528
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:23,620
HEIDI ROIZEN: First of all,
education is changing, and the

529
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,840
role of education,
higher education.

530
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,560
I mean, there's massive stuff
on that, and I won't go into

531
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,630
it except to say I'm the parent
of one college age

532
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,340
student and one person applying
to college, and I'm

533
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,530
still strongly encouraging them
to go to college and get

534
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,410
their degrees.

535
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:39,620
And I teach at Stanford, where I
strongly encourage people to

536
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,750
get their degrees because
for better or worse--

537
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:46,030
first of all, Stanford has a
pretty good filter and so many

538
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:49,880
of things that apply talking
about accelerators, talking

539
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,540
about going to a higher
institution of

540
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,010
education like Stamford.

541
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:57,385
And also, I believe the degree
is a driver's license, and it

542
00:22:57,385 --> 00:23:00,300
is a minimum criterion for
certain things and for certain

543
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,120
places, and it helps you.

544
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,810
I have a few degrees from
there and it helped me.

545
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:09,020
Stay in school, kids,
if you can.

546
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,820
A little bit of the problem is
some of the very smartest

547
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,990
people I know, school isn't for
everybody, and the lore is

548
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:15,720
you look around--

549
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,790
Mark Zuckerberg, and Bill Gates,
and Steve Jobs, and I

550
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,790
mean, the list there is quite
a few people like that.

551
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,830
But there are a couple people
who win the lottery every year

552
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:25,810
too, and that doesn't mean it's
a good strategy for you.

553
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,610
AUDIENCE: No, I already
finished school.

554
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,190
HEIDI ROIZEN: I think that there
are so many programs and

555
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:32,270
there are so many universities
now that understand that

556
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,040
entrepreneurship.

557
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,640
And when we say
entrepreneurship, that doesn't

558
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,300
even just mean founding
companies.

559
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,170
It also means being an
entrepreneur within an

560
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:41,130
environment, going to work for a
startup, understanding that.

561
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:41,820
That's what I teach.

562
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,510
I teach entrepreneurship,
but I really teach more.

563
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,460
It's almost like a
psychology class.

564
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,900
So I think you can go do that.

565
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,100
I think there are
many programs.

566
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,470
There are many undergraduate
and graduate institutions

567
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:54,110
where you can almost do your
entire startup working on the

568
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,290
startup and take classes.

569
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:58,160
And you take your marketing
class, and you take your

570
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,290
channel class, and you take your
financial modeling class,

571
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:05,250
and you just use them all to
work on your startup, and so

572
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:08,720
you could almost get a degree
kind of incidentally.

573
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,880
So I think those things can
happen and I would encourage

574
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,570
you do that, but I think there's
a tremendous amount of

575
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:15,060
material that's also
available online.

576
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,690
And particularly as it relates
to the business side of being

577
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,800
an entrepreneur, there's
a lot of material.

578
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,060
Again, Brad Feld has written--

579
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:26,440
he's been prolific about doing
books and being a great source

580
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:26,930
of material.

581
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,930
So if you go to feld.com and
poke around, you can find

582
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:34,610
other ways without having to
pay the expensive tuition.

583
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:37,620
I'd encourage you to look
at some of the Stanford,

584
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,700
particularly the Stanford MOOCs
that are going on this

585
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,410
summer because they're
all free.

586
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:45,320
DON DODGE: Heidi, this question
came up last year and

587
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,770
Paul Buchheit answered
the question.

588
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,130
He answered it this way.

589
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:52,380
The best training for
doing a startup is

590
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,020
to work at a startup.

591
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:58,680
So Paul worked at Google, so
he picked a good startup to

592
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,500
work with because there were
only just a few people there.

593
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,230
But truly, the best training for
starting a company is to

594
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,460
work at a startup.

595
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,010
NAVAL RAVIKANT: Just to riff on
that, I think asking if you

596
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:10,570
should go to college or not, I
mean, it's highly contextual.

597
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:13,090
Don't go to the University of
Phoenix and end up in debt.

598
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:14,960
Do go to Stanford if
you get the chance.

599
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,970
So it does depend on your
opportunity cost, who you are,

600
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:19,580
where you are, what you want out
of life, and how much it's

601
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,540
going to cost you.

602
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,980
That said, I would say if you
want to be in this business,

603
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,890
learn technology.

604
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,790
Best case, get a CS degree,
double E, mechanical

605
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,630
engineering, math, something
like that.

606
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:32,740
If not, worst case, go to Code
Academy, spend 12 weeks, bury

607
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,040
your head, go to Block,
go to Code Monk.

608
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,700
Just learn the code, learn
design, learn the rudimentary

609
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,510
parts of it.

610
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,520
It's a little silly to be in
the business of technology

611
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,340
without understanding the
technology and the

612
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,034
tools are all there.

613
00:25:44,034 --> 00:25:44,441
DON DODGE: Great.

614
00:25:44,441 --> 00:25:47,310
Next question.

615
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,620
AUDIENCE: Having a successful
startup is really hard, and

616
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,460
you guys are in the business
of funding startups.

617
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,420
The success rate is very low.

618
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:57,440
After a few good exits, what
makes you stay in the game and

619
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,620
what makes you think you'll
have another great exit?

620
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:03,980

621
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,360
NAVAL RAVIKANT: I think to get
in the game in the first

622
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,460
place, you have to
be fundamentally

623
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,840
broken at some level.

624
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,886
I don't think success
fixes that.

625
00:26:11,886 --> 00:26:19,870
[LAUGHTER]

626
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,090
JESSICA LIVINGSTON: I don't
know if I'm fundamentally

627
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:23,310
broken, but I'm maybe
a little crazy.

628
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:26,120
I just love working
with the founders.

629
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,980
I mean, every single day is
different and it's just so

630
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:32,850
exciting to be part of their
journey, especially when you

631
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:36,510
start with them so early on when
they get rejected over

632
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:39,420
and over and have so many
problems that they face and

633
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,790
they overcome them.

634
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,040
It's exhilarating.

635
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,750

636
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,600
HEIDI ROIZEN: As an older
member of the venture

637
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,600
community, I think that there
are no higher highs and no

638
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,000
lower lows than being an
entrepreneur, and I will never

639
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,560
be more proud of anything than
the work I did when I was an

640
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,960
entrepreneur.

641
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,855
But that's a lifestyle that
burns you out, and I did it

642
00:27:01,855 --> 00:27:02,870
for 14 years.

643
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:05,320
And so at the end of that I
said, I really love this

644
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,170
stuff, but it's like being a
parent and then deciding,

645
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:10,520
maybe it would be easier
to be a grandparent.

646
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,040
You can hand them back
when the diaper

647
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,610
needs changing or whatever.

648
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:17,370
So I think that for venture, and
I know a lot of the people

649
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:20,690
that enjoy venture, they love
the thrill of the entrepreneur

650
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:23,250
and being with entrepreneurs
and doing fun, interesting

651
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:26,440
things, but in all honesty, they
just don't want to work

652
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,320
as hard and they don't
necessarily have that

653
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,650
passionate spark
to be intensely

654
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,610
driven to do one thing.

655
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,560
And so they go into this line
of work and this line of

656
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,960
work's pretty fun because you
get to be on the sidelines and

657
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,930
be helping, but you aren't
necessarily the one who's

658
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:44,820
having both those high highs
and those low lows.

659
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,580
DON DODGE: The other thing is
as an entrepreneur, you can

660
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,780
only do one thing.

661
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,980
You're heads down on one idea.

662
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,720
When you're an investor, you
can invest in 10 different

663
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,810
companies and live vicariously
through them and help them.

664
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:59,880
So most of the investors
that I know do it

665
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,840
because they love it.

666
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,380
They don't really do
it for the money.

667
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,050
They do it because they love it
and they love to help build

668
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:09,420
companies and build people
and do great things.

669
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,060
And they make money along the
way, too, but it's not the

670
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,050
driving force.

671
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,990
Ask Ron Conway about that.

672
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:17,490
He stopped working for money
about 40 years ago.

673
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:19,410
He does not need
any more money.

674
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:22,990
But no one works harder than he
does because he just loves

675
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:25,560
what he does, and most investors
are like that.

676
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,810
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

677
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,650

678
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:29,280
AUDIENCE: Hello.

679
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,330
My name is Taylor.

680
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:33,130
I'm from Costa Rica.

681
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:36,700
Down there, we have a lot of
smart people, a lot of great

682
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:41,650
ideas, but sadly, we don't have
a culture of investment

683
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:46,770
and startup accelerators,
something like that.

684
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:51,865
So I wanted to ask if you have
options, or do you offer

685
00:28:51,865 --> 00:28:56,050
possibilities to companies from
outside of the United

686
00:28:56,050 --> 00:29:00,220
States, and also if there are
any regulations or something

687
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:07,100
that might stop investors from
this country to give money to

688
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,400
companies in other countries.

689
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,400
NAVAL RAVIKANT: It's a
super hard problem.

690
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,730
There are regulatory issues, but
that's just one of many,

691
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:16,540
many, many issues.

692
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:19,110
Probably the biggest one is just
at a very early stage,

693
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,560
investing is a people
business.

694
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,235
And so you don't know the
people, you don't know the

695
00:29:23,235 --> 00:29:24,345
network, you don't
know the culture.

696
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,140
You don't even know what
you don't know.

697
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,220
So it's very difficult to
invest in an early stage

698
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,810
startup that's overseas.

699
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:33,800
At Angel List, we do a bit
of overseas matching--

700
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,270
in fact, that's where I think
we add the most value-- but

701
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:38,470
generally, those companies need
to have a fair bit of

702
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:40,470
traction because that's
what it takes to

703
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,800
pull a remote investor.

704
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,170
And even then, it's pretty
rare and difficult.

705
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:47,540
So surprisingly to me, the way
that most international

706
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:51,360
companies get funded these days
is they actually move to

707
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,280
here, which seems backwards.

708
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,680
But actually, there are
accelerators that do nothing

709
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,210
but cream skim and import
from entire countries.

710
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:59,780
And it's a very valuable
service, but

711
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,610
that's what they do.

712
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:02,930
UpWest West does it from Israel,
and Startmate does it

713
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,650
from Australia, and there's
a Korean one, a

714
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:05,850
Japanese one, and so on.

715
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:06,290
DON DODGE: Seedcamp.

716
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:08,900
NAVAL RAVIKANT: Yes, exactly,
Seedcamp from Europe.

717
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,110
So it's expanding.

718
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:10,870
It's getting better.

719
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:13,040
But the good news is, the great

720
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,950
liberator here is the internet.

721
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:17,470
Every year that goes by, online
transactions get a

722
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:19,400
little bit easier, the knowledge
gets a little bit

723
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,310
more distributed, remote working
and collaboration gets

724
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:25,200
a little bit further, and
companies that were trapped

725
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,500
geographically in one area can
suddenly address markets in

726
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,930
another area thanks
to the internet.

727
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,490
So I think it is improving,
but it's going

728
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,350
to be a long cycle.

729
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,770
It's not an overnight thing.

730
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:38,060
I'm a little pessimistic in
that I actually think the

731
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,740
internet will solve
the problem before

732
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,620
the politicians do.

733
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:45,035
I think the internet will get
there before the visas do.

734
00:30:45,035 --> 00:30:45,460
DON DODGE: Great.

735
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,390
Next question.

736
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:48,600
AUDIENCE: Hi.

737
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,820
My name is Marcus.

738
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,870
I'm from Brazil, but it has
been three months that I'm

739
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:56,960
living in Canada, and there,
we are working on an idea.

740
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,730
And we have the prototype, we
have the landing page, we have

741
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:05,060
a great team, but we
can't afford the

742
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,840
launching for many reasons.

743
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,990
So the question is,
what's next?

744
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:15,970
DON DODGE: What do you need to
see to fund the company?

745
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,710
So you've got the product,
you've get the

746
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,840
team, you've got--

747
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,130
AUDIENCE: We just can't afford
the launching for many

748
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,520
reasons, so what's next?

749
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,870
NAVAL RAVIKANT: Is it hardware
or software?

750
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:27,790
AUDIENCE: Software.

751
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:30,820
But we need servers
and everything.

752
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:34,510
We can't afford it if people
start to use it.

753
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:39,745
So how can we get funding before
launching the project?

754
00:31:39,745 --> 00:31:41,270
NAVAL RAVIKANT: I mean,
the obvious thing is

755
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,920
just launch it anyway.

756
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,100
Come on, what? $250 Hiroku
server or AWS.

757
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,350
Just get something up there.

758
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,500
At least then you can start
talking to investors and

759
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,570
accelerators and people who
might be able to help you to

760
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:53,390
the next step.

761
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,140
And there are accelerators
in Canada.

762
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,660
You can apply to YC from there
as well, and maybe get down

763
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,390
here for an interview.

764
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,740
Drive across country
if you had to.

765
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,380
What was it, Brian Chesky, sell
cereal if you have to.

766
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,880
JESSICA LIVINGSTON:
Sell cereal boxes.

767
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,890

768
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:11,190
Sorry to interrupt you, Naval,
but you brought up and it's

769
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,130
sort of a funny story.

770
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:16,280
But certainly, you could
apply to Y Combinator.

771
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,530
If you can't do that, I've seen
lots of variations on how

772
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:20,440
to bootstrap.

773
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,530
I mean, if you can't charge
customers, the story from

774
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:26,590
Airbnb is that they
were destitute.

775
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:29,210
They could not pay for anything,
and they were

776
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:30,430
designers from RISD.

777
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,890
So it was around the
presidential campaign here and

778
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:37,710
they thought, OK, let's design
these kooky cereal boxes.

779
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:39,540
And they had Captain
McCain cereal

780
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,680
that was Captain Crunch.

781
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,950
Hopefully, you know
what that is.

782
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:46,320
And Obama Os that were
a take on Cheerios.

783
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,930
And they said, gosh,
let's see.

784
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,310
We'll make them a limited
edition and sell

785
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,000
them for $40 each.

786
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,110
And they made thousands and
thousands of dollars, and

787
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:58,580
that's not only how they paid
their rent, but they actually

788
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,935
wound up eating the cereal when
they couldn't afford to

789
00:33:00,935 --> 00:33:02,185
go grocery shopping.

790
00:33:02,185 --> 00:33:04,410

791
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:06,740
DON DODGE: The other answer is
the natural progression of

792
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:10,530
funding is your first money
comes from friends and family.

793
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:14,440
So the first $10,000 or the
first $50,000 comes from

794
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,460
friends and family, and
that gets you far

795
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,270
enough to get it launched.

796
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:21,170
And then your second money
comes from angels, former

797
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,720
entrepreneurs or angel
investors or

798
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,600
that kind of thing.

799
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,630
And it's only after that that
VCs will actually get involved

800
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,360
and give you even more money,
so start there.

801
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,210
HEIDI ROIZEN: But I'm going
to jump in on that.

802
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,460
First of all, don't take any
money from people who cannot

803
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:38,110
afford to lose it because as
much as you love it and as

804
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:40,970
much as your parents love you
or whatever, if people give

805
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,890
you money that they can't afford
to lose and you lose

806
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:45,250
it, I just think it's
a bad way to live.

807
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,580
So number one, that.

808
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:50,310
Number two, it's funny.

809
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:52,690
With all due respect to what
you just said, you're not

810
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,250
technical, right?

811
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:57,160
My undergraduate degree was in
creative writing, so there is

812
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,690
a future in technology even
for people who don't code.

813
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:01,400
I did code.

814
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,840
Nobody would want to buy my
code, but all you guys who

815
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,550
code and women who can code, you
need people like us to do

816
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,950
all that other stuff you
don't want to do.

817
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:11,880
So there's a future, even for
those of us who don't.

818
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,260
NAVAL RAVIKANT: To clarify,
my point was you should

819
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,429
understand the technology.

820
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,520
I don't write the code for Angel
List, but I at least

821
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,090
know a little bit of
what's going on.

822
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,810
HEIDI ROIZEN: And after this
many years in this business, I

823
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:22,199
know a little bit
about it, too.

824
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,560
But I will say this.

825
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,350
I'm not a technologist, but I
know some really simple math

826
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:31,810
about companies and ownership,
and there's only ever 100%.

827
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:32,790
It never changes.

828
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:33,820
You can't change it.

829
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:37,480
You can make the percentages
worth more, but you can't

830
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,280
create more.

831
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,600
So be very careful about
taking money

832
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,750
on by selling equity.

833
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,100
If you do that, you are diluting
your company, you are

834
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,010
setting up expectations, you
are putting people in a

835
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:51,639
situation of needing you to get
liquidity so that they can

836
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:54,730
sell the company or take it
public or whatever, and they

837
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:58,510
have limited time frames of how
long they're going to wait

838
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,090
to get that money.

839
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:02,790
So I just say that to say, try
to think about raising money

840
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:06,610
and imagining that none of
our categories existed.

841
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:09,850
And before our categories
existed-- because even venture

842
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:12,280
is a relatively new thing.

843
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,990
I mean, it certainly wasn't
around 100 years ago.

844
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:18,080
People made money these
kinds of ways.

845
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,090
They did consulting.

846
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,780
They did other products.

847
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,460
They worked on nights
and weekends.

848
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,790
They stole from their
employers.

849
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,990
I'm not recommending that,
clearly, but I'm just saying

850
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:30,540
there's all sorts of ways
that people get

851
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,320
companies off the ground.

852
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,610
And unfortunately, I think
what's happened, and

853
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:36,800
particularly here in
Silicon Valley--

854
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,780
I think it's one of the
downsides of being here with

855
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,430
all the positive things, is
everybody thinks the first

856
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,580
thing you do here is you get
money from other people and

857
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,710
you sell equity to do it.

858
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,780
And I would argue that's
actually not the greatest way

859
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,860
to start a company, and I would
look at all these other

860
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,030
ways to do it.

861
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:51,300
DON DODGE: OK.

862
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,820
We have four minutes left.

863
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,750
NAVAL RAVIKANT: Email me.

864
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:54,810
You can guess my email.

865
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:55,710
AUDIENCE: OK. thank you.

866
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,540
DON DODGE: We have four minutes
left so we're going to

867
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,720
go into the lightning round.

868
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,250
That means you ask the question
15 seconds, and we

869
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,410
answer in about 30 seconds.

870
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:05,460
Go ahead.

871
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,470
AUDIENCE: So my question is for
Jessica and Y Combinator.

872
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:10,740
I know last year, you announced
that you would be

873
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,620
accepting applicants from people
who didn't even have an

874
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,170
idea for a startup yet.

875
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:16,710
Was that successful?

876
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:19,890
What are you looking for in
people who have no idea?

877
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:21,140
And what have you learned
from the process?

878
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,650

879
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:23,880
JESSICA LIVINGSTON: Yeah.

880
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,230
That was called the No Idea
Track, and we thought, there's

881
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,700
a lot of smart, talented
people out there.

882
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,330
We should let them apply even if
they don't have an idea and

883
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,510
we can help them.

884
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:38,280
It wasn't the best experiment,
to be honest.

885
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,170
But that said, we funded a lot
of people who we didn't like

886
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,350
the idea that they applied with,
and we've worked with

887
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,800
them, and they have new ideas.

888
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:51,670
So we'll continue to fund people
without ideas, I think.

889
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,100
DON DODGE: Awesome.

890
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,670
Next.

891
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,170
AUDIENCE: I'm Victor.

892
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,120
I'm from Ghana.

893
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,750
Jessica mentioned earlier that
only 2% of the people that

894
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,190
apply get taken at
Y Combinator.

895
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:06,960
And you also mentioned that a
lot of people you fund are

896
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,760
from other countries, from
outside the United States.

897
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:17,270
And Naval mentioned that it's
difficult for you to actually

898
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:22,750
fund people who are not
based in America.

899
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:23,830
I come from Africa.

900
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,980
The problem is the
other way around.

901
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,710
You have a lot of people
who have ideas but

902
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:29,430
who do not have money.

903
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:31,640
Here, you have the money but
you don't have the ideas.

904
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,100
DON DODGE: You need
to ask a question.

905
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:38,920
AUDIENCE: Don't you think
there's something wrong with

906
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,970
the funding model here?

907
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:44,370
Don't you think you probably
need to scale it beyond the

908
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:47,260
shores of America because there
are people there who do

909
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,070
not have the expertise
but have the money.

910
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,695
They want to know
how to invest.

911
00:37:50,695 --> 00:37:52,670
I've been on both sides
of the table myself.

912
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,850
I've lost money.

913
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:55,770
I've also been an
entrepreneur.

914
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,130
So what we do not have
there is knowledge.

915
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:59,620
Don't you think that
model should be

916
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,410
scaled beyond the US?

917
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:04,750

918
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:05,480
HEIDI ROIZEN: Yes.

919
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,770
I mean, I think it should.

920
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:11,270
But I think the point is if we
don't do it, it's because our

921
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,370
model is working here.

922
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,670
And I would argue that there are
actually a fair number of

923
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,810
ideas here, and part of the
reason is because all of you

924
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:17,800
are here in this room.

925
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,280
So just look around the room
and understand you all did

926
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,380
something to get here.

927
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:24,720
So this model is working for
this, but I think the model

928
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,730
needs to be more distributed
and it will over time, and

929
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:28,680
people will change that.

930
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,926
You've got to find the right
people to change it.

931
00:38:30,926 --> 00:38:32,430
NAVAL RAVIKANT: Think of
it as an ecosystem.

932
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:35,120
People are funding the animals
within the ecosystem to find

933
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,260
the things to eat.

934
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,460
If the ecosystem isn't there,
you can't fund the animals.

935
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:42,240
You can't fund the fish
in the desert.

936
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,662
We have to build the ecosystem
too, and that takes time.

937
00:38:45,662 --> 00:38:46,110
DON DODGE: Thanks.

938
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:48,850
Next question.

939
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:49,170
AUDIENCE: Hi.

940
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:53,720
So in regards to what you said
about equity, what would you

941
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,700
recommend to give up
for investments

942
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,180
instead of an equity?

943
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:02,520
If you were put in a situation
between giving up equity or

944
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:06,980
being put in a perpetual
royalty, which would you

945
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:10,750
believe is more beneficial
to a company?

946
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:14,040
HEIDI ROIZEN: Never sign up for
anything that's perpetual,

947
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,510
I mean that doesn't
have an end.

948
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:18,840
So I mean, things that I think
you can consider doing, for

949
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,830
example, do a white label
version of the product for a

950
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:24,440
customer that is going to-- let
them exploit it all they

951
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,620
want, but don't give them rights
to future development

952
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:30,680
and don't give them rights to
resell it to other people.

953
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,260
One of these we did early on to
bootstrap our company is we

954
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,640
realized that we could
handle two byte code.

955
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,480
I know this is really ancient
history, I'm sorry.

956
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,440
Back in the '80s, CPM day,
anybody remember that?

957
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,110
And our biggest competitor
could not.

958
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:45,560
So even though they were much
bigger than we, we went over

959
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,680
to Taiwan, Japan, Korea.

960
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,410
We went places where two byte
code mattered and we did

961
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:54,270
basically countrywide site
licenses because we could sell

962
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:57,165
to one OEM and we could bring
in a couple hundred thousand

963
00:39:57,165 --> 00:39:58,570
dollars and that could
fund the company.

964
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,750
We said, what are the chances
we're actually going to get

965
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:03,260
over to Korea in any
near term and be

966
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,670
selling directly to consumers?

967
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,510
It was like zero.

968
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:08,680
But everything should have an
end because someday, you're

969
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,450
going to want to sell your whole
company and you need to

970
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,470
be able to own the rights to the
core of what you're doing.

971
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:16,200
Because I've also seen
developers do this where

972
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,900
they'll say, fund me and I'll
give you a 10% royalty for the

973
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,630
rest of my life on the product,
and they create

974
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,255
unfundable companies.

975
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:24,340
DON DODGE: All right,
last question right

976
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,570
here in the red shirt.

977
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:25,750
AUDIENCE: Hi.

978
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:26,450
My name is [INAUDIBLE].

979
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:27,690
I'm from New York.

980
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:30,130
So you mentioned about
college dropouts.

981
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:34,140
So I'm working with two lovely
ladies who are professors from

982
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,510
New York and they're
past their 40s.

983
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:41,010
So what do you think about
age and startups and that

984
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:43,250
collision, because so
far, it's targeting

985
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:46,670
the 20 years old.

986
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,530
DON DODGE: So age,
does that matter?

987
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:51,360

988
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:55,840
AUDIENCE: Yeah two co-founders
in their 50s, not dropouts.

989
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:59,890
HEIDI ROIZEN: Neither
young nor old.

990
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,000
I mean, there could
be brilliant

991
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,240
people who are young.

992
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,890
If anything, I think the
problem around here is

993
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:06,610
everybody thinks if you're too
old, you must not have

994
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:08,730
anything good you can do.

995
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:12,110
I think that there are some
generational differences and

996
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:14,640
age doesn't matter
to me at all.

997
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,440
It's about what you
know how to do.

998
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,900
AUDIENCE: They are
not as agile.

999
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,350
They cannot move.

1000
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:20,145
They have other
responsibilities.

1001
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:21,395
But OK.

1002
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:23,690

1003
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,270
NAVAL RAVIKANT: I would give
them every bit of success,

1004
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:29,230
perceived or actual, for
five years back.

1005
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:29,600
DON DODGE: All right.

1006
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,870
I'm sorry, we have to end.

1007
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:31,760
We're out of time.

1008
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,300
But thank you all very
much for coming.

1009
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,850
[APPLAUSE]
