MALE SPEAKER: Hi, everyone.

3
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,580
We've had a little bit
of a snafu with

4
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,570
our live stream today.

5
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:45,290
So if you just go to this link
up here, or click the link

6
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:49,590
inside this pre-recorded thing
here, you'll see the actual

7
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,550
video of Jake Archibald and Addy
Osmani talking about Dev

8
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,370
Tools in relation to
Chrome or mobile.

9
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,850
If you're watching this live
now, I'm sorry for actually

10
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,780
the mistakes that we've made.

11
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,330
Sounded really bad, actually.

12
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,600
It's basically we pre-recorded
the show.

13
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,260
And the actual quality of the
show when we broadcast it live

14
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:08,960
wasn't great.

15
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,450
And we want you to have the
best quality possible.

16
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,130
So go and look at this link.

17
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,720
And you'll be able to see
everything that happens and

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,110
that we talked about
around Dev Tools.

19
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,010
See you soon.

20
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,260
Bye bye.

00:01:19,260 --> 00:02:04,783
