1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,670
PAUL IRISH: Hi, and welcome
to The Breakpoint.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,700
This time, I'm joined
by John McCutchan.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,770
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Hey, everyone.

5
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,470
PAUL IRISH: And we're going to
talk about remote debugging

6
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,270
and getting a lot more insight
as far as what's going on on

7
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,660
your mobile device.

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,800
There's a lot of tools inside
of Chrome DevTools to deal

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,670
with this and specifically
identify the pain points that

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,970
you're having with performance
that you encounter on mobile.

11
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,350
We're going to show a few
cool things today.

12
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:30,000
We're going to show seeing the
things that are unique to

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,750
mobile inside the DevTools
Timeline.

14
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,645
We're going to cover
about:tracing and extracting

15
00:00:34,645 --> 00:00:39,060
one of those traces from the
phone, show off things like

16
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,880
Continuous Paint, and
talk about why all

17
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,030
this matters so much.

18
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:42,450
Sound good?

19
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,710
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah,
that sounds great.

20
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,650
PAUL IRISH: All right, so first
up, we're going to dive

21
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,700
into an app by the
"New York Times"

22
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,130
called the Times Skimmer.

23
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,220
And we're going to take a look
at the timeline of it.

24
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,720
So I have this up here
on my phone.

25
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,390
And meanwhile, I'm also
in Chrome DevTools.

26
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,130
So I've already set this up
to do remote debugging.

27
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,580
We'll show that in
a little bit.

28
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,560
But I'm going to come over here
to the timeline and start

29
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,450
a new recording.

30
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,240
And now that I've got that
going, I'm just going to

31
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,580
navigate to the new section
on my phone.

32
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,665
So Times Skimmer is just going
to navigate over to--

33
00:01:13,665 --> 00:01:17,070

34
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,810
there he goes.

35
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,560
And that's going to come in.

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,870
So I got a few things
going on.

37
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:28,750
That's why the phone is
a little sleepy here.

38
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,945
But we're going to end
the recording.

39
00:01:30,945 --> 00:01:33,710
You can hit Command-E as
a little shortcut.

40
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,800
And we can dive in to what's
going on here.

41
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,746
So it looks like quite a bit.

42
00:01:39,746 --> 00:01:41,750
One of the things we see--

43
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,420
this, actually, right here, so
this is a Rasterize call.

44
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:51,520
And the reason why it's an
empty, hollow bar is because

45
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,770
it happens off the
main thread.

46
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,700
There's a lot of things on
Chrome on Android that do not

47
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,140
happen inside the UI thread.

48
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,770
Whereas on desktop, currently
some of them do.

49
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:04,120
And this hollow bar indicates
that that is happening

50
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,000
off-thread, which means that
this click event handler where

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,250
we go into jQuery and we start
doing things, this can all be

52
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,410
happening in parallel because
this is operating on a

53
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,230
separate thread.

54
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,178
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Nice.

55
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:17,150
PAUL IRISH: We go down here.

56
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,860
We see all these paint and paint
and paint and paint and

57
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,990
paint and paint and paint.

58
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,700
All of them, they're very small,
and they're not taking

59
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,300
up a lot of time.

60
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,310
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: How long
are they taking?

61
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,780
PAUL IRISH: Let's see.

62
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,410
So we've got about a
millisecond each.

63
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,220
That adds up.

64
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:37,900
So we're targeting 16.6
milliseconds for 60 FPS, so at

65
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,635
almost a millisecond
each, this is--

66
00:02:40,635 --> 00:02:41,640
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It's going
to take a while.

67
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,670
PAUL IRISH: It's going to
absorb quite a bit.

68
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,220
So this is going to be
a little chunky.

69
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,640
But sometimes it's hard to
identify what's going on here.

70
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,100
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to turn on another mode

71
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,810
that we have.

72
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,490
So I'm going over
to the Settings.

73
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,760
I'm using the question mark--

74
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,260
it's a little shortcut--
to get into Shortcuts.

75
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,350
I go over to General.

76
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,970
I'm going to turn on Show pane
rectangles and composited

77
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,355
layer borders.

78
00:03:03,355 --> 00:03:05,020
Now, I come back.

79
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,230
And on the phone, what we're
going to see is anything that

80
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,000
gets painted is going to be
rendered in a red rectangle.

81
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,340
Anything that is composited
as a layer onto the

82
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,850
GPU has gold borders.

83
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:24,335
And so this time, I'll try
recording in Timeline again.

84
00:03:24,335 --> 00:03:27,260
And we're going to navigate
once more.

85
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,980
And now you see a few things.

86
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,250
You see that there was just a
moment where there were gold

87
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:38,850
borders around all the icons on
the side of the navigation.

88
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,410
And then there was
a blink of red--

89
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,850
red paints again.

90
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:48,710
And the content is on its way.

91
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,110
But now when we take a look
at what's going on in our

92
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:57,770
Timeline, these small little
42 by 45 paints make a lot

93
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,370
more sense.

94
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,700
Even if I hover over them, we
see on the phone, a little

95
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,500
blue area indicating the
dimensions of where that is.

96
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,180
So right now, it's showing up
in the top left corner.

97
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,410
And in about a week from now,
that'll be showing up right on

98
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,470
the space where that
paint was done.

99
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,890
But you're getting a good idea
of the dimensions of that

100
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,110
paint and seeing where
it came from.

101
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,130
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So that means
I'll be able to, from within

102
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,600
Timeline, hover over a paint
and see the visible

103
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,580
region on the phone?

104
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:26,830
PAUL IRISH: Exactly.

105
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:26,970
Yeah.

106
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:27,750
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: That's
awesome.

107
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,140
PAUL IRISH: So not just the
duration of it, but we have a

108
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,240
map of the location on where it
happened and the dimensions

109
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,760
of the paint itself.

110
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,490
And like I mentioned, there's a
small bug in location right

111
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,320
now, but that's on
its way out.

112
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,530
So this is pretty cool.

113
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:47,070
So I'm getting a sense of not
only the full performance

114
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:50,260
view, not just what's happening
in JavaScript, but

115
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,660
all my paint costs as well,
and it can identify

116
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,850
what's going on.

117
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,390
And so this is a good example
here where it looks like we're

118
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,500
parsing a bunch of HTML.

119
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,610
It's taking a while.

120
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,010
We're still parsing HTML.

121
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:08,900
I think some JSON has come back
from this XHR, and we're

122
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,240
now sending it through a
templating engine and piping

123
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,360
it into the DOM.

124
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,190
And it looks like this indicator
is telling us that

125
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,350
we have a forced synchronous
layout as a possible

126
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,230
performance bottleneck.

127
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,910
And why is it forced?

128
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,080
It's happening inside here.

129
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,160
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So is
this the call stack?

130
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,600
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, so this is the
call stack of what led up

131
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,070
to the layout being forced.

132
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,880
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: And so this is
where the layout was forced in

133
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,136
the bottom left.

134
00:05:35,136 --> 00:05:35,490
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

135
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,230
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: OK, great.

136
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:40,620
PAUL IRISH: So I can click in
here and identify that--

137
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,120
so, inside app source, it's
this guy right here.

138
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,410
This.offsetHeight is a known
property that forces layout.

139
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,590
The browser has figure out the
new geometry of the page.

140
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,030
And so I know where
this is happening.

141
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,810
And then if I want to get a good
idea of why we needed to

142
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,330
even call that, we can watch
this call stack and see that

143
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,660
we were in mark, notify.

144
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,250
We were getting JSON
back here.

145
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,850
But we needed to do some work
in order to figure this out.

146
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,360
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: That's
really cool.

147
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,790
To be able to see on the
Timeline that there's a really

148
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,780
expensive layout operation going
on and then just jump

149
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,130
right to the call stack, that
gets you right to the source

150
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:19,610
of the problem.

151
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,040
PAUL IRISH: Right.

152
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,160
And so then the next thing best
to do at this point is to

153
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,550
eradicate this.

154
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,530
Basically, anytime you see this
little indicator, we want

155
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,090
to get rid of it.

156
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,690
And so in this case, if we can
avoid hitting offset top at

157
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,580
this point-- maybe we can ask
for offset top earlier in the

158
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,790
application, cache that, and
then just apply that value

159
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,260
inside here so that we don't
have to go ask the DOM, hey,

160
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,130
what's the news story in the
geometry of the page?

161
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:49,530
That would mean that we don't
have this big jump between

162
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:52,464
these operations, and then it
would be a lot more snappy.

163
00:06:52,464 --> 00:06:53,390
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: That's cool.

164
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,900
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, so that's a
very quick summary of the

165
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,680
power of the DevTools Timeline
on mobile and getting a good

166
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,890
sense of what's actually
happening.

167
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,970
There's things that I didn't
show as far as image decodes

168
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:04,960
and image resizes.

169
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,080
If you've seen these times on
desktop, you can expect them

170
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,450
to take, on mobile, around 6 to
10 times the duration that

171
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,610
you're used to on desktop.

172
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:20,160
So all those costs are much more
expensive on the mobile.

173
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,710
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So that means is
if your site is running in,

174
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:28,180
say, maybe 10 milliseconds per
update frame on desktop, then

175
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,650
you could expect 100
milliseconds, maybe?

176
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,490
PAUL IRISH: Pretty much.

177
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,820
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: That's
a big difference.

178
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,940
PAUL IRISH: It hurts.

179
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,950
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So the most
exciting thing for me about

180
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:41,350
DevTools on mobile is that
it's the exact same as

181
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,880
DevTools on desktop.

182
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,430
So everything that you learn in
using the tools on desktop

183
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,460
is applicable on
mobile as well.

184
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,070
It looks like we just lost
our connection, but we'll

185
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,498
reestablish that.

186
00:07:53,498 --> 00:07:55,370
PAUL IRISH: We should
have that back.

187
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:55,838
There we go.

188
00:07:55,838 --> 00:07:57,450
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: There we go.

189
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:57,950
PAUL IRISH: Cool.

190
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:05,480
So we'll take out these
settings for now.

191
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:05,850
Yeah.

192
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:11,640
So do you want to show a little
bit more about:tracing?

193
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,130
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah.

194
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:12,590
Yeah.

195
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,420
So for those of you aren't
familiar with about:tracing,

196
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,850
this is a real low-level staring
at the guts of what

197
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,970
Chrome is doing when it's
rendering your site.

198
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,080
And so the way you access this
on the desktop is you navigate

199
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,450
to about:tracing.

200
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,510
And you can start a capture,
and it captures it.

201
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,409
But since this is a mobile, it's
a little bit different.

202
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:35,940
And I've been maintaining
a Python script

203
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,370
that activates it.

204
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,659
And so let me just
run it right now.

205
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,030
And when I do this, Paul, could
you just navigate a

206
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,040
little bit on the device?

207
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,610
PAUL IRISH: Sure.

208
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,570
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: OK,
are we ready?

209
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:46,820
PAUL IRISH: Ready.

210
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,470

211
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,120
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So there's a
little balloon pop up, and

212
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,200
Paul's going to navigate,
maybe scroll around.

213
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,728

214
00:08:57,728 --> 00:08:59,084
How are we doing?

215
00:08:59,084 --> 00:08:59,790
PAUL IRISH: There we go.

216
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,950
We've got both things, scrolling
and navigating, so

217
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:03,210
we're good.

218
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:03,580
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: All right, so
we're going to press Enter

219
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,260
there, and the balloon will pop
up on the mobile device

220
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,700
saying that the capture is
complete and that it's going

221
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,950
to copy it over to
the desktop.

222
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:17,000

223
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,800
So I'll just load
up chrome.json.

224
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,730
Wow, 16 megs-- a lot
of data in there.

225
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:25,231
This is pretty low level.

226
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,390
Oh, now this is starting
to look interesting.

227
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,680
So we have some animations
here, stacked

228
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,540
on top of each other.

229
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:35,480
PAUL IRISH: Are these keyframe
CSS animation?

230
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,730
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: There's comps
that are animation.

231
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,950
So let's see here.

232
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,150
We'll zoom in.

233
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,160
So there's the VSync tick, so
this is kicking off the draw.

234
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,020
And now, here you can see that
we're preparing to draw.

235
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,000
We're doing the layout.

236
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,290
Everything is being updated.

237
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:57,160
When you really need to get this
low-level, nothing beats

238
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,300
Chrome://tracing.

239
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,840
And it works just like it does
on the desktop once you've

240
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,600
captured the data.

241
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,170
PAUL IRISH: And actually, you
have a whole other GDL session

242
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,040
on this tool, what
you can learn.

243
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,510
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah, I did a
GDL on Make the Web Faster in

244
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,650
December of last year,
so check it out.

245
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,760
I go into a lot of detail on the
value of this tool and how

246
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,000
you can use it to actually
instrument your JavaScript

247
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,600
code on top of just
instrumenting the

248
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
internals of Chrome.

249
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,880
I highly recommend it.

250
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,800
PAUL IRISH: It's good.

251
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,930
You look at this interface,
and it's

252
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:29,910
pretty daunting at first.

253
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,490
And there's a fantastic amount
of information there.

254
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,530
And once you get used to reading
it, you can extract

255
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,830
some really useful
insights in it.

256
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:37,330
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah.

257
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:40,070
To give you an idea, we spent
about an hour and a half

258
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:44,380
discussing Chrome://tracing in
this Make the Web Faster GDL,

259
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,910
and we're still just scratching
the surface.

260
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:50,600
So this is a tool for experts,
but you need it to truly

261
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,570
understand what's happening.

262
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,240
PAUL IRISH: And one last thing
we'll show you is that there's

263
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,530
a new feature that we're working
on that we want to

264
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:00,730
show off that's called
continuous

265
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,920
page repainting mode.

266
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,420
And so we're going to come
back to the DevTools, and

267
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,500
we're looking at one of the
pages inside Times Skimmer.

268
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,890
So we're going to turn on
continuous page repainting.

269
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,850
So what this does is it
basically says, browser, just

270
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,940
continue to paint, again
and again and again.

271
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,140
I know that you've painted it
once, but paint it over

272
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,160
because I am going
to do some work.

273
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,960
I'm going to play around
a little bit.

274
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,920
So once we turn it on, we have
the little feedback on how

275
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,740
long our paints are taking
on the phone.

276
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,000
And then we can go inside of
the DOM and start to play

277
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,860
around a little bit.

278
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,480
So in this case, I'm
going to go in--

279
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:37,810
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So, hold on.

280
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,730
Before you do that, why don't
we talk about the graph,

281
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,460
actually, that is partially
visible in the upper

282
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,230
right-hand corner of
the mobile device?

283
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,730
So when mobile painting is
turned on, you get a min and a

284
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:51,910
max paint time and the previous
frame's paint time

285
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,530
and then a graph of
all of this data.

286
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,000
So it's really interesting
to see.

287
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,750
And the workflow here is you can
toggle on and off elements

288
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,830
and toggle on and off styles,
and you can try and determine

289
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,940
the cost of painting a specific
element with its

290
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,590
style, which Paul's going to
demonstrate right now.

291
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,450
PAUL IRISH: First thing, I'm
just going to bring us back to

292
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,140
the page we were looking at.

293
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,390
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Cool.

294
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,730

295
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,020
There we go.

296
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,730
PAUL IRISH: All right.

297
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:24,860
So now that we're back here,
one thing that we can

298
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:28,280
experiment with in continuous
page repainting is taking

299
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,210
things off.

300
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,590
So there's a H shortcut.

301
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,550
Now, you can use it all
the time if you just

302
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,770
want to hide something.

303
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:39,890
So just hit H, and it will
hide that DOM node.

304
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:44,450
And so in page repainting mode,
what we're looking for

305
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:50,980
is what effect not painting that
element at all has on the

306
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,250
time to repaint.

307
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:56,370
So if it has a big, significant
drop, then we know

308
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,260
that this element and its
children are currently

309
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:03,630
contributing quite a bit to
the cost of painting.

310
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,900
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah,
that's exactly it.

311
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,120
You're playing the
subtraction game.

312
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,270
If I turn this element off or
disable a style on it, the

313
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,530
time goes from being 100
milliseconds to 90

314
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,230
milliseconds.

315
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:18,590
So you can conclude that
that element cost 10.

316
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,080
PAUL IRISH: And then once we
find out the elements that are

317
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:25,370
costly, we can start working
through our styles in here in

318
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:29,250
the DevTools, toggle them on
and off, and identify what

319
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,080
parts of things are
contributing.

320
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,570
And sometimes just images will
be contributing, like a large

321
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:36,980
image will have a pretty
significant paint cost.

322
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,850
Other times, you'll be finding
box shadow and border radius,

323
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:44,100
and maybe some other CSS styles
will be contributing.

324
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,980
But here, you'll finally get an
idea as far as if you are

325
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:52,140
seeing large paint times in your
Timeline, we can identify

326
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,852
what exactly is really
contributing to those.

327
00:13:55,852 --> 00:13:58,950
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah, just like
we were able to find the

328
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:02,940
call stack for the expensive
forced layout, you're

329
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,930
searching in that same sense for
the needle in the haystack

330
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,150
of why is paint so expensive?

331
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:11,550
And you can determine that just
by subtracting the paint

332
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,180
time for each element.

333
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,600
And you'll find one element
or a few elements that are

334
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,170
particularly expensive.

335
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,520
PAUL IRISH: Right.

336
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,380
I think the last thing we should
add here is why this is

337
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,640
all important.

338
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,740
One of the big things that comes
up again and again when

339
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:30,670
it comes to performance and
mobile is that a lot of times,

340
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,550
the mobile web experience isn't
as fast as it could be.

341
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:36,030
So this is really critical
to understanding, why?

342
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:36,940
What is going on?

343
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,130
It might not just be your
JavaScript is taking slow.

344
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,870
It might be things like paint.

345
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,930
But you really want to get
an idea of what are your

346
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,940
bottlenecks, so you
can adjust them.

347
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,700
The speed of scrolling is
something that we didn't

348
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,240
really touch on too much.

349
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,740
But you can also test this
inside the DevTools by going

350
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,080
into settings and trying
out the FPS meter.

351
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,040
So this is similar to continuous
page repainting.

352
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,870
It gives you a little meter on
what the frames per second is,

353
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,810
and I can scroll the page
and identify how

354
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,520
well things are doing.

355
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,880
Maybe something on the page
is really affecting

356
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,140
my scrolling speed.

357
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,330
But knowing that your page can
scroll fast means a huge

358
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:19,865
difference to your users when
they're using your site or

359
00:15:19,865 --> 00:15:20,810
application.

360
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:23,420
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: What was the
quote from Facebook where they

361
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,160
went down from 60 frames per
second to 30 frames per second

362
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,440
and saw a significant
drop in their users?

363
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:30,820
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

364
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:36,800
So having a less fidelity
scrolling experience really

365
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,610
hurts the engagement that
people-- like Facebook, who

366
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,410
ran an experiment and
got data on this--

367
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,100
have been seeing.

368
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:48,070
So targeting your scrolling
performance and your start-up

369
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:51,880
performance on mobile is really
key to holding on to

370
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,230
your user's attention
and engagement.

371
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:53,930
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah,
and you hit on a

372
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:54,810
really important point.

373
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:56,510
It's very important when
doing performance

374
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,940
work to measure first.

375
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,720
You always want to measure and
determine, oh, it wasn't the

376
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,740
scripts that were slow.

377
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,330
It was actually this image
decode or a certain paint.

378
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:09,790
Once you have that data, you can
take the right action to

379
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,830
make the biggest impact.

380
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,170
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

381
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:17,860
Lastly, we started this up
really fast, so we didn't show

382
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,300
off exactly how we got remote
debugging started.

383
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,450
If you just look up remote
debugging in Chrome DevTools,

384
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,670
this is a recently released
article all about

385
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,810
how to get set up.

386
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:33,676
Right now, so you'll have to
grab the Android SDK, and

387
00:16:33,676 --> 00:16:36,360
you're going to use a little
tool called ADB that connects

388
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,620
your phone to your machine
over USB and sets

389
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,230
up that data transfer.

390
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,470
But the instructions
are all here.

391
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,290
It's pretty straightforward
to get started there.

392
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,360
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah, the
instructions are on

393
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,940
developers.google.com, and I
have an article on HTML5

394
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,330
Rocks, which also goes over
continuous paint mode on

395
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,340
mobile and getting your
device connected.

396
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,580
PAUL IRISH: Is that out?

397
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,550
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It's coming
out next Tuesday.

398
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,120
PAUL IRISH: Nice.

399
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,420
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So by the
time you watch this--

400
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,290
PAUL IRISH: So check out
html5rocks.com, covering

401
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,740
pretty much all the stuff
that we just talked

402
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,300
about in this episode--

403
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,890
how to get set up and how to
identify and improve the

404
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,020
performance on your mobile web

405
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,430
applications and mobile websites.

406
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,322
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah.

407
00:17:16,322 --> 00:17:17,369
PAUL IRISH: Cool.

408
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,910
Thanks very much for
watching, guys.

409
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:19,210
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Thanks.

410
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,460
PAUL IRISH: Cheers.

411
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:27,610
