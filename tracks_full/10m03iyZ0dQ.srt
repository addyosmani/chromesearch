00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:02,560
TOM BROXTON: Hello.

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,190
Good morning.

4
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,930
Good afternoon, rather.

5
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:07,870
This is Josh Sassoon.

6
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,450
JOSH SASSOON: This
is Tom Broxton.

7
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,070
TOM BROXTON: And we're
designers on the user

8
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,550
experience team at YouTube, and
we wanted to talk to you

9
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,600
today a bit about how we
design products in a

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,060
multi-screen world.

11
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,410
We wanted to give you a bit of a
kind of a factory tour and a

12
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,870
peek behind the curtain of some
of the ways that we do

13
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,860
things at YouTube and some of
the reasons behind some of the

14
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,030
changes that you'll be seeing on
YouTube in the future, and

15
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,640
then what some of those
might look like.

16
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,430
We'd give you a little
sneak peek of that.

17
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,830
So with that, I'll hand you over
to Josh, and he can begin

18
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,460
by telling you a little
bit about YouTube.

19
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:48,310
JOSH SASSOON: So just to take a
big picture view of YouTube,

20
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,970
YouTube is actually a
really, really tough

21
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,870
problem to design for.

22
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,610
And when you think about
YouTube, it's probably just,

23
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,310
up to a lot of people, a place
where you go for cat videos.

24
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,680
But when you think about
YouTube as a corpus of

25
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,640
content, it's a huge
unstructured, massive corpus

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,560
with a huge breadth
of content--

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,560
everything from cat videos
to revolutions--

28
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,010
and it really doesn't have
a consistent structure.

29
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,800
YouTube is kind of this "Choose
Your Own Adventure"

30
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,140
experience.

31
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,930
And it's important to or step
back from YouTube and

32
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,580
understand what YouTube
is and what it isn't.

33
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,190
And YouTube really isn't like
any other service out there.

34
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,820
Nothing like it exists.

35
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,330
YouTube is essentially
the container for the

36
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,680
entire world of video.

37
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,140
Everything is on YouTube.

38
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,980
Everything on YouTube is
uploaded, and it can be

39
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,490
virtually anything.

40
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,930
And on top of that, our
audience is everyone--

41
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,830
everyone across the world
and every demographic.

42
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,410
Everyone watches YouTube.

43
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,220
And what's great about YouTube
is it's unique in its ability

44
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,420
to provide for this incredible
universal experience.

45
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,610
And it can also be an
incredibly personal

46
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:54,955
experience.

47
00:01:54,955 --> 00:01:57,910
It's both of those things, so
we have to really find a

48
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,950
balance between that.

49
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,950
We have to find a way to show
everyone in the world "Gangnam

50
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,730
Style." And on the more personal
level, I personally

51
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,290
am learning how to play the
violin off of a series of

52
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,479
YouTube videos from a creator
in a completely different

53
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,400
state, and it's very
personal to me.

54
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,930
And that's a very different
experience than the universal.

55
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,760
So the beauty of YouTube is
that there is this shared

56
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,250
experience that's universal, and
it's very collaborative.

57
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,580
I think most everyone's heard
of the "Harlem Shake" meme

58
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,420
that came up recently, where
not only did it start on

59
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,970
YouTube, but it was actually
because of YouTube that

60
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,420
everyone was able to collaborate
and create these

61
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,180
videos and parody and mimic
each others' videos and

62
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,370
actually create something that
wasn't there because of

63
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,660
YouTube as a platform.

64
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,670
And then on the more personal
level, there's this really

65
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,870
intimate, social aspect to
YouTube, where people have

66
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,700
YouTube parties.

67
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,120
They crowd around a phone or a
laptop, and everyone's dying

68
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,210
to share a video with
one another.

69
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,660
So we have this incredible
challenge of balancing, again,

70
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,560
the universal and the personal
and anything that can be a

71
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,070
completely global phenomenon to
something that's very much

72
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,490
social and intimate that's just
your group of friends.

73
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,970
And the end experience of
YouTube is incredibly hard to

74
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,140
describe because of that.

75
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,260
So most people will say that
YouTube is overwhelming, that

76
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,160
they can't really capture it
or describe in any way.

77
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,960
It doesn't have enough structure
or anything that's

78
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,250
consistent enough about the
corpus of content to really

79
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,140
capture in any way.

80
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,230
And there's this common feeling
amongst our viewers

81
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:28,020
that it's hard to decide what
to watch next or how to

82
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,660
discover something new or
how to find something

83
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,890
that they'll love.

84
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,640
And on top of that, it's even
harder for them to refind it

85
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,430
or to collect it in a way where
they know how to keep

86
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,010
track of it.

87
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:40,360
And so the general sentiment
is, I know that YouTube has

88
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,590
everything on it.

89
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,450
I just don't know how
to make sense of it.

90
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:48,260
And that's what makes it such a
tough problem to design for.

91
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,020
TOM BROXTON: And so as YouTube
keeps growing and our

92
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,510
relationship with online video
grows and changes, and what

93
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:56,680
online video is grows and
changes, we're really moving

94
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:03,190
from being this web-based site
to being a service running

95
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,330
across a multiplicity
of devices.

96
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:09,690
So we begin to think about
YouTube as a platform upon

97
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:14,330
which we can share content out
the world, to people wherever

98
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,860
they are and whatever
they're looking at.

99
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:22,780
So at the moment, we feel that
we've got a series of apps,

100
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:27,640
each specialized on their own
platform, that tries to take

101
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,120
the best aspect of that platform
and allow you to get

102
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,150
to the content in the way that
that platform makes sense.

103
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,930
But the problem with this is
that it gives the impression

104
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,710
to our viewers that something
you found or bookmarked or

105
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,770
saved in one place isn't
available in another place.

106
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:48,000
And it doesn't give a great
sense of one service and one

107
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,220
set of videos that you're
looking on across the world.

108
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,290
So as we work on our next
generation of product design,

109
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,790
we're really thinking about how
can we harmonize that so

110
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:03,900
we can move away from this sort
of web first, and these

111
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:10,260
other devices second, to a
service that's at the center

112
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,820
of everything with thousands
of devices and thousands of

113
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,030
products that are pointing into
this, so you can connect

114
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,840
to the content you want at the
right time in whatever way

115
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,310
suits you best.

116
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,820
And as designers, we really want
to provide this in a way

117
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,120
that's delightful and enjoyable
to everyone, to make

118
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,160
that connection experience
exciting.

119
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,470
Because from cat videos to
revolutions, people tell us

120
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,610
about these amazing and
inspiring experiences that

121
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,840
they have on YouTube.

122
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,700
And we really see our job as
connecting those people

123
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,840
together and making it really
easy for those kind of

124
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,330
connections and experiences
to happen.

125
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,010

126
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:53,260
So at Google, at YouTube, we
really believe that the way to

127
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,830
do this, the way to achieve
great design that is relevant

128
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,170
to people is to really
understand the people,

129
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,020
understand the user and their
needs and what they're trying

130
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,050
to get out of things.

131
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:08,320
So the problem with that is, as
Josh has already said, the

132
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,410
breadth of our audience is
such that many of the

133
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:15,580
traditional methods that I
learned for understanding the

134
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,980
audience that are coming to your
site or to your service

135
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,180
are quite ineffective.

136
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,980
So one of the great tools we
have to address this at

137
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,100
YouTube, or one of the great
assets we have to address this

138
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:30,310
at YouTube, is a strong research
team who can really

139
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:34,850
come up with some innovative
ways of addressing the user

140
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,360
needs, understanding user needs,
and finding ways to

141
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,060
address them.

142
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,400
So they come up with some really
innovative methods,

143
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,850
especially for attacking this
problem of how things change

144
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,960
as we move to a more
device-centric world.

145
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,120
They've come up with some really
innovative ways to

146
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,880
tackle this.

147
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,080
And I wanted to share some of
those with you, because I

148
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,620
think they're really
interesting, and then some of

149
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,730
the high-level insights that
we're taking away from those

150
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:04,350
and what we're learning about
why people use our service the

151
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,030
way they do.

152
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:09,290
So just to explain
how this works.

153
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:12,200
They've been running a series
of large-scale diary studies

154
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,820
when they send out these
booklets to volunteers, and

155
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,340
people record and share daily
activities about how video

156
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,400
consumption fits into
their life.

157
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,840
There's a variety of exercises
in the books--

158
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,440
day-by-day diaries and these
time wheels that I'll explain

159
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,270
a little bit more in a moment.

160
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:33,020
And the overall effect was
that they gave us some

161
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,130
insights into what people are
doing during the day.

162
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:40,890
So this is the time wheel
diagram I was just describing,

163
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:45,150
and the idea of this is that
people can record and give us

164
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:50,260
insight into how their day
works, what devices they're

165
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,460
using to consume media and
video during the day.

166
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,920
So here, the little markers
show where they are, what

167
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,360
they're doing.

168
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,640
So you can see transport, on I'm
at home, or I'm at work,

169
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,085
and who they're with as well, so
we get an understanding of

170
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:08,660
kind of social activity.

171
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:13,230
And then the inside purple ring
is phone activity, and

172
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,860
you can see the short
phone interactions.

173
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,630
And then we've got
a tablet wheel.

174
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:22,930
The laptop is the yellow, and
TV is the long sessions that

175
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:26,100
you see on the outside.

176
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,960
And then, we can take many,
many, many of these diagrams,

177
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,419
and we can use many clever and
also not so clever methods of

178
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,460
processing them and looking at
patterns and try to get these

179
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:41,860
patterns and understand the
behaviors and motivations as

180
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,210
to why people pick up a
particular device and use it

181
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,470
in a particular way and
what they're trying

182
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,070
to get out of it.

183
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,050
And then, we can check those
against the actual traffic

184
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,520
patterns that we see
coming to our site.

185
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,620
And we can see how these things
match up, and there's a

186
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,820
lot of information you can
draw from that kind of

187
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,870
comparison.

188
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,460
So to begin to get to some of
the insights that we're

189
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,040
drawing out of these--

190
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,820
that's just one method.

191
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,530
There are quite a lot of other
pieces that we're using.

192
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,640
So we try to draw all these
together into some insights

193
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,990
that I could share
with you today.

194
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,890
And the most basic starting
ones are just some device

195
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:21,525
principles that as designers we
like to get down to a sort

196
00:09:21,525 --> 00:09:24,660
of framework or a set of ideas
that we can all agree on so

197
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,040
that when we talk about phone
or tablet with each other as

198
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,420
we develop products, we'll have
a sort of basic, shared

199
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,770
understanding of how
these things work.

200
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,340
So I want to share that with
you quickly to begin with,

201
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,500
because it underpins a lot
of what's following.

202
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,310
So I'll just go through them
quickly, device by device.

203
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:47,010
The phone is sort of typified by
this pattern you see in the

204
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:51,370
purple there of really morning
til evening, like I wake up

205
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,180
til I go to bed.

206
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,570
It's always with me, and it's
these fast, frequent

207
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,450
interactions.

208
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,250
You know how it is.

209
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,620
You're always checking
your phone.

210
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:04,445
You're almost like a chicken
pecking at the corn.

211
00:10:04,445 --> 00:10:09,550
But what we do notice is that
a lot of this interaction is

212
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,320
reactionary.

213
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:17,560
So people are really getting
status notifications or

214
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,710
updates, or people are telling
them about something.

215
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:23,820
So phone-based interactions are
what we're thinking of as

216
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,300
reactionary.

217
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,520
And the other thing we really
notice about the phone--

218
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,540
and people talk about it
in interviews-- is

219
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,410
how personal it is.

220
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,670
People are very unwilling
to let their phone go.

221
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,130
So you've got a strong chance
that the person on the end of

222
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:38,550
that device is the person
you think it is.

223
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,950
The only exception really to
this personality or the

224
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:45,930
personal nature of the phone
is in child pacification,

225
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:46,920
where we constantly see.

226
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,630
And these are people who'll just
hand over any device to

227
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,810
get some peace.

228
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,030
So that's the one person
who might be on the

229
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,070
other end of the phone.

230
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:59,320
And another surprise for us was
just that although people

231
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,930
often use the term phone and
mobile interchangeably, we're

232
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:07,040
trying to stop doing that,
because there's less mobile

233
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,770
usage on the phone then
you'd expect.

234
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,820
I was expecting a lot of it to
be kind of on the bus or

235
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,300
traveling, and a lot of mobile
usage is actually at home.

236
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,230
More than half of the usage
we're seeing is

237
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,480
from within the home.

238
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,710

239
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:24,710
So the tablet, to kind of
contrast that, it seems to

240
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,310
have a slightly surrogate role
in people's lives, and the

241
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:30,310
usage is slightly unclear.

242
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,520
People often talk about using
it instead of some other

243
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,990
device, so instead of my phone
or instead of my laptop or

244
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,750
something like that.

245
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,090
The marked difference from the
phone is that usage seems to

246
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,480
be planned much more.

247
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,850
People talk about downloading a
movie to watch later to take

248
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:47,800
on the bus, on the train, or I
want to read a book in bed.

249
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:54,020
So it tends to be more
ritualistic and less habitual.

250
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:57,640
And so that's leading us to
the conclusion that using

251
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,700
scaled up phone UIs on
the tablet is not

252
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,710
always the best idea.

253
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,720
The reason people could
be using it

254
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,840
could be slightly different.

255
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,580
And the surprising thing is
people don't seem be using

256
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,270
them-- at least for video--
people don't seem to be using

257
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,720
them as much as they
think they do.

258
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,850
If you ask them in an interview,
they'll say, oh, I

259
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,710
always use my tablet.

260
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,260
I love my tablet.

261
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,070
And then when you look at the
patterns through the day, the

262
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:22,550
tablet usage is much lower than
they suggest themselves.

263
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,760
The PC, just quickly,
is to perceived much

264
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,810
more as a work device.

265
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,440
Usage is much more
in the daytime.

266
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,480
This is especially true with
the arrival of the tablet.

267
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,160
People, as I said, instead of,
people are switching much more

268
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,570
of their usage towards
the tablet.

269
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,780
And the other interesting
point we noticed--

270
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,640
even though we think so much
about living in a kind of

271
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,180
post-desktop world,
post-keyboard world, there are

272
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,780
still so many organizational
tasks that people can't

273
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,080
achieve through these
other interfaces.

274
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,480
People still talk about turning
back to their laptop

275
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,010
as a control panel and as
a device to, in the end,

276
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:57,640
organize things and
complex tasks.

277
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,270
And finally, the TV is still
sort of the epicenter of video

278
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:04,820
consumption.

279
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,870
Everything else seems to
revolve around the TV.

280
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,650
Sessions are longer,
less interactive.

281
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:11,910
You see these big orange bars.

282
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,390
And they're pretty constant.

283
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:17,200
Through all of the research
that we're doing, we see

284
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,290
people have it on in
the background.

285
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,280
It's often associated
with multitasking.

286
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,350
You'll see the phone or the
tablet, all these things being

287
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,260
used at the same time.

288
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,800
And our important takeaway for
the TV is really that it's a

289
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,570
shared device or it's
a social device.

290
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:37,190
People are very aware that there
are many people looking

291
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,820
at the screen at
the same time.

292
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:43,930
So be careful about what you
put up on the TV and are

293
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,890
sharing, since through
social data, people

294
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:48,500
don't appreciate that.

295
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,760
There's a couple of interesting
trends or sort of

296
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,210
continuums that we notice that
run across all the devices in

297
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,570
the order that I showed them.

298
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,930
So as you go from a small screen
size to a large screen

299
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:03,030
size, session length
and the length of

300
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,190
videos viewed increases.

301
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,860
It's kind of intuitively
sensible, right?

302
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:11,610
You're more likely to watch
a movie on the TV.

303
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,130
But also, interactions
go down.

304
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,090
So people want to interact
less with a screen that's

305
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,710
bigger and further away.

306
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,900
And whereas phone is a habitual
device-- the way

307
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,810
we're describing is phone is
habitual device, and the TV is

308
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,540
a ritualistic device.

309
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,700
People have times of day when
they want to go to their TV,

310
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,920
but as I said, they kind of pick
up and use the phone all

311
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,980
through the day.

312
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:34,290
And again, it seems to kind of
spread according to the screen

313
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,310
size across all of
the devices.

314
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,650
And the personal
issue as well.

315
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,792
Phone is a very personal device,
and TV is seen as a

316
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:44,590
very social device, and tablet
somewhere in the middle.

317
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,820
I'm sort of happy to share my
tablet in the way that I'm not

318
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,070
happy to share my phone.

319
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,510

320
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:53,500
So the second insight that
really came out of this

321
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,860
research was thinking about the
time of day and how people

322
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,050
use their devices
through the day.

323
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:03,010
And the main key takeaway
underlying all of this was

324
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:05,360
really just people are
incredibly busy.

325
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,220
They've got these
furious lives.

326
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,185
They're picking up kids.

327
00:15:09,185 --> 00:15:12,410
They're working, doing all this
stuff, and it's really

328
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:15,060
important to fit into
their schedule.

329
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,120
So when we listen to our users,
we hear, especially

330
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,670
with the phone, that I need
to be in control.

331
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,060
I want to decide when I
come in and go out.

332
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,470
I don't want to be distracted
too much.

333
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,710
So we need to get out of their
way at the right moment.

334
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:33,260
And ideally, they really want
us to get us to where they

335
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,890
want to be without them
having to ask.

336
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,930
Obviously, the less
interaction they

337
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,360
can get, the better.

338
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,390
So when we think about what
they're doing went through the

339
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:50,470
day, a pattern that emerges as
successful is sort of punchy,

340
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,360
short news content
in the morning.

341
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,230
People are quite ritualistic
about checking in and finding

342
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,350
out what's going on at the
beginning of the day.

343
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:02,320
And then easygoing, pushed at
you entertaining content in

344
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,690
the evening, when perhaps you
want to switch off a bit more

345
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,525
and you don't want to be
constantly making choices.

346
00:16:07,525 --> 00:16:10,950

347
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:14,340
So that tracks by
device as well.

348
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:19,850
So the phone, you tend to see
these sort of short, frequent

349
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:23,000
status-snacking behavior.

350
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,150
And UIs that work well with
that tend to be these more

351
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,600
feed-like UIs, where I can
check in, find out

352
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,760
what's going on.

353
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,450
I want a sense of what's
going on in the world.

354
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:40,640
Whereas on TV, something more
static and relaxing, less

355
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,720
about scrolling, more about
what's the content that I want

356
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,570
to be watching next
and you tell me.

357
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:48,310

358
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:53,660
So a third aspect that helps us
when we're trying to think

359
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,900
about designing these different
UIs is thinking

360
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:02,300
about the level of control and
trust that people need to have

361
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,330
over an interface.

362
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:06,569
So there are two sort
of modalities of

363
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:08,390
behavior that we see--

364
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:13,410
the "I know what I want" versus
the "Entertain me." We

365
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:14,450
notice that they
call for really

366
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,500
two separate UI paradigms.

367
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,400
One end of this continuum we're
thinking of as like

368
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,109
trust based and one
control based.

369
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:25,800
And if we think about a user's
intent along this continuum,

370
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,910
it helps us to design a feature,
a and what to watch

371
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:32,090
next after you've watched one
video on TV is an interesting

372
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:34,620
example of this.

373
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,120
On TV, we have the added
challenge that we've got these

374
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,180
very limited control input
devices, the D-pad controls.

375
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,010
And combine that with this
idea that we're trying to

376
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:49,160
optimize for these long,
relaxing evening sessions, and

377
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,730
we really find that the last
thing you want is to kind of

378
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,940
bombard people with these
horrific walls

379
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,285
of choices of videos.

380
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:59,360
So it works quite well on the
PC or on the desktop, where

381
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,350
you give people lots of choices,
and they can see what

382
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,110
it is they're after.

383
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,370
On the TV, you show somebody a
wall of videos like this, and

384
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,620
they'll just turn it off.

385
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,330

386
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,850
As somebody pointed out, it's
sort of like asking a kid,

387
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:11,940
what vegetables do you
want for dinner?

388
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,780
And they'll just be like,
nothing, or chips.

389
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,360
They'll jump back to what
they're familiar with.

390
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,650
Whereas you might be better
off asking them something

391
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,250
like, do you want broccoli
or carrots?

392
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,460
And then you kind of
more likely to

393
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,920
get a useful reaction.

394
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,070
And it's kind of the same with
video consumption as well.

395
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:31,110
We find if you give them a big
bombardment of choice, they

396
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,310
tend to react badly.

397
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:37,250
You give them a small number
of choices, then people are

398
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,020
much more positive about
taking one of them.

399
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,365
So what we try to say with these
kind of interfaces is

400
00:18:43,365 --> 00:18:45,930
here's what we think you
want to watch next.

401
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,020
You might also like--

402
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,460
So we still give some
opportunity for serendipity

403
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,350
and a little bit of control,
like letting people go, but

404
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:56,390
we're really concentrating
on trust.

405
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:00,850
And we're experimenting with
different ideas and different

406
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:05,730
UIs, title cards that might
allow more sort of insight

407
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:10,090
into the set of videos that
you're watching such that we

408
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,480
gain sort of extra trust at
the beginning of the talk,

409
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,660
that you can really have more
faith that the videos that are

410
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,290
coming up are the kind of videos
that you're going to

411
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,700
want to be watching, rather than
giving the people this

412
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,080
feeling that I'm just
lost in the sea of

413
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,360
thousands of videos.

414
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,570
That way, I can lean back
and enjoy the content.

415
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:33,540
The opposite end of the scale
to this might be when people

416
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,730
really want control.

417
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:38,550
And as I said before, an
interface that's really great

418
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,410
for this is the phone.

419
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:44,900
And so, we're really looking
at ways that we can combine

420
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,770
these experiences.

421
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:50,350
So you might already see, we've
already got a UI that

422
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,570
allows you to connect the phone
YouTube experience to

423
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:59,790
your TV or to any other
large screen and let

424
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,100
you pair the two.

425
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,550
So you can send a video
from one to the other.

426
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,840
And these are incredibly
successful at achieving this

427
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,400
kind of high control.

428
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,405
How do I get to the video I
want, and then how do I share

429
00:20:10,405 --> 00:20:11,650
it with people?

430
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:14,280
And the reaction's incredible.

431
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,100
If they can find it,
people describe the

432
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,770
experience as magical.

433
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:21,110
Especially if you've ever tried
to input a text search

434
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:24,620
through using a D-pad control,
you'll just know that these

435
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,888
kind of interfaces are
light years apart.

436
00:20:27,888 --> 00:20:30,580

437
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:36,230
And the final piece that's
helping us coming out of this

438
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:41,010
and various other research is
the emotional connection.

439
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:44,670
So I mentioned earlier how some
of the more traditional

440
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:48,150
frameworks for thinking about
who your users are and what

441
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:51,370
they want out of your products
are not working or don't work

442
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:53,900
so well when you're user
base grows beyond

443
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,510
the hundreds of millions.

444
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,540
So we're really having to find
new ways of trying to

445
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,620
empathize with people.

446
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,680
And again, the research team
have come up with some pretty

447
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,080
innovative thinking
around this.

448
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,610
And so rather than thinking
about the personas and the

449
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:09,360
type of people coming to
YouTube, they're pushing us to

450
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,780
think about people's
motivations

451
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,080
behind why they're coming.

452
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,820
And they're putting together
a framework that presents

453
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,880
content in such a way that it
can fit to people's moods.

454
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,410
And we see this as making it
more likely for them to engage

455
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,060
with the content in
a positive way.

456
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,810
So an example I'm sort of giving
here of a framework we

457
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:32,440
might be trying to feel out is
under "feeling," we think

458
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,390
about people seeking a mood,
following a story.

459
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,170
I'll give some examples
of that.

460
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,950
And then "learning," I guess,
is more obvious.

461
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:41,960
We've got a lot of educational
content, but we also see a lot

462
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,000
of how-to videos and
reviews on YouTube.

463
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,900
And that's very important,
popular content.

464
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,480
"Knowing." We were talking about
people sort of being in

465
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,950
the know and finding out
what's new and popular.

466
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:58,910
A lot of people come and they
want to see the latest videos.

467
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,130
So how do we accommodate
those?

468
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,490
What's the right UI for somebody
coming in in that

469
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,950
kind of frame of mind?

470
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:08,500
And then "connecting" is
comments and discussions, but

471
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,820
also sharing with friends,
how we take

472
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,880
those experiences back.

473
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,460
And that hopefully connects
people back to the top of the

474
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,670
circle, where you can connect
with your friends and share a

475
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:23,810
feeling with them, and then
they can learn and share.

476
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:26,940
And that kind of framework, it
helps us build our use cases

477
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,230
and think about what success is
for a product and what we

478
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,350
should expect people
to get out of it.

479
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,190
An example of where
you might apply it

480
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,240
could be through language.

481
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:42,160
So "make me laugh" could well
be a phrase that is more

482
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,750
likely to trigger a positive
reaction to the kind of

483
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,990
content people want to connect
with than, say, "pets and

484
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:51,290
animals," which is the more
logical place you might want

485
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:53,560
to go to look for cat videos.

486
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,780
But people don't really come in
looking for cat videos and

487
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,270
then think, oh, I'll click on
"pets and animals." But if you

488
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:01,370
say "make me laugh," they can
kind of relate to that.

489
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:03,840
So with that, I'll hand it back
to Josh, who's going to

490
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,035
explain a little bit about how
you can apply these kind of

491
00:23:07,035 --> 00:23:08,890
lessons to design.

492
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:11,000
JOSH SASSOON: So as Tom
mentioned, we do a ton of

493
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,420
qualitative research to
address a lot of our

494
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,020
challenges.

495
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:17,080
And what we need to do in
combination with that is use

496
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:22,220
data and quantitative analysis
to really kind of finish the

497
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:26,350
entire design process and make
sure that we're thinking about

498
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,280
this in a well-rounded manner.

499
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,470
So we think a lot about how can
database design actually

500
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,460
help us with our design
decisions when we're trying to

501
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,570
organize and present
videos to viewers.

502
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:38,620
And we use a lot of analysis to
try and figure out how can

503
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,200
we go from something that feels
messy to something that

504
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,440
feels very intentional and

505
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,990
something that feels organized.

506
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,510
And within something that feels
organized, how much

507
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,580
hierarchy do we show?

508
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,730
How much density or how
much diversity of

509
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,560
content do we show?

510
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,430
And a lot of our analysis on
the quantitative side can

511
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,240
really help us with that.

512
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,980
We have tons and tons of ideas
as we do design explorations.

513
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,420
But as Tom said, at the scale of
our user base, it's really

514
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,000
hard to just go with your
gut and say, this

515
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,810
is going to be great.

516
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,180
Because that doesn't really work
for the entire world or

517
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,540
for hundreds of millions
of people.

518
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,560
So we really need to use
data to validate

519
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,190
a lot of our ideas.

520
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:16,980
And this is just an exploration
where we use

521
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:20,430
quantitative analysis to think
about, how big is a thumbnail?

522
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:23,710
How often do we group and
cluster thumbnails together?

523
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:26,970
How can we actually balance
density and diversity?

524
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:31,730
How can we show through one
UI across platforms a nice

525
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:35,180
balance of universal and
personal content together and

526
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:38,270
make it feel easy to
understand and not

527
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:42,310
overwhelming, depending on
what device you're using?

528
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,570
This is an exploration where
we're really thinking just

529
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:47,000
about tons and tons
of diversity.

530
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,860
Just show a lot of stuff, and
hopefully people will make a

531
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,520
good decision.

532
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:57,530
But then, we'll do another
exploration that's similar but

533
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,810
much more minimal and
much less dense.

534
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:02,340
And we can run these two
things together as an

535
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:06,840
experiment, and through
quantitative analysis, we can

536
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,770
really make better decisions
about what really does work

537
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:12,290
better and what leads our
viewers to longer, more

538
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:15,260
successful sessions
on our product.

539
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:20,050
And this is an exploration,
actually, where we're

540
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:23,190
thinking, how can quantitative
analysis help us determine

541
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,390
what layout to use?

542
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,240
Should there be any hierarchy?

543
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,950
And in the case of this, this
is a very dense exploration

544
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:31,720
that feels very newsy and
has a masonry layout.

545
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,990
And how much hierarchy should
we expose at all?

546
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:38,350
How much does this actually
impact our viewers' perception

547
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,870
of YouTube as a destination that
they need to come back to

548
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:44,700
often as a news source or as a
newsfeed versus something that

549
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,730
feels very editorial and curated
and is much less

550
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:50,980
dense, and perhaps only shows
one to two pieces of content

551
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,520
above the fold?

552
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:57,080
And we have to think about all
of these explorations in the

553
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,390
spectrum, and on top of all
that, think about them across

554
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:03,230
platforms and think, how does
this actually translate and

555
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:07,110
become recognizable when you
take that same design and you

556
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:09,690
throw it onto a tablet or you
throw it onto a phone?

557
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,900
And what does that
actually mean?

558
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,980
A lot of the stuff that Tom
spoke about earlier--

559
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:18,690
the need for more control or
perhaps more personal snacking

560
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:19,470
on a phone--

561
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:22,600
is very different on a phone
than on desktop, where you

562
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,560
want a ton of options and
perhaps a lot more diversity

563
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,600
and even a sense of more
hierarchy to help you quickly

564
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,270
identify a type of content
you want to watch.

565
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:37,640
This is another interesting
place that we use quantitative

566
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,890
analysis, which is actually
analyzing our channel creators

567
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:44,150
and their content and figuring
out what type of content they

568
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:46,620
actually have and how we can
group it together and make it

569
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,410
more meaningful and how we can
present what they want to

570
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:52,470
watch next from a channel--
whether it's episodic content

571
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,790
that's meant to be viewed
sequentially or whether it's

572
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:58,110
music content or whether it's
from a large library of videos

573
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,890
that don't actually need to be
viewed in a certain order.

574
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:03,410
We've got tons and tons of
creators that are making

575
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:06,230
amazing new types of content
that don't fall into the

576
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:10,330
traditional, sequential sort
of show or movie sort of

577
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:10,930
content types.

578
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:13,690
So we have to really work hard
to analyze and understand what

579
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:16,210
our creators are doing and then
find the best ways to

580
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:19,680
actually present that and
cluster it to show viewers and

581
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,910
subscribers on our
browse pages.

582
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:26,270
So that kind of takes us to some
of the explorations that

583
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:30,660
we're taking from all of these
insights and actually moving

584
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,240
closer to a little bit of a
sneak peek into how we're

585
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,000
trying to solve the problems
we've just been discussing.

586
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,660
And some of it is just
really obvious--

587
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,520
identifying primary user needs
and actually streamlining them

588
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,650
visually across platforms and
doing things that actually

589
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:50,780
connect our core actions in
a unified visual language.

590
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,060
Something as simple as taking
our subscribe button and

591
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,840
making sure that it scales and
is recognizable across

592
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,840
platforms actually does a huge
amount to help our viewers

593
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,800
recognize and understand that
when they subscribe to

594
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,540
something, that actually
means something.

595
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,540
And when they pick up their
phone after they subscribe on

596
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,680
desktop, that that same channel
and that content will

597
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,790
be there, or that they'll
be able to refind it

598
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,170
later on their TV.

599
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:14,280
And that, again, we're a
service, and not just a site

600
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,490
that has a bunch of disparate
apps connected with it.

601
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:19,850
Some of the other work that
we're doing is just doing some

602
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:22,540
basic unification, both visually
and in our UI, of our

603
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,760
navigation.

604
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,430
Getting our viewers to
understand every time you open

605
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:30,780
up YouTube on any platform
that that navigation will

606
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,420
actually get you back
consistently to the place that

607
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,260
you recognize, whether it's
the What to Watch feed or

608
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,560
whether it's a specific
channel.

609
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,860
And that kind of takes us into
this bigger picture that we're

610
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,840
thinking of for YouTube and a
lot of the design principles

611
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,090
we've already mentioned.

612
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:50,860
But thinking about YouTube as
this single service that

613
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:55,080
transcends or goes across any
platform, that's easy.

614
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,430
It has this basic underlying
structure that you can

615
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:02,320
understand, that helps balance
the universal and the personal

616
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,460
and makes the experience at any
time of day, any type of

617
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,490
user, any type of content
understandable.

618
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:13,210
And then balance that with
what YouTube is kind of

619
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,880
culturally known for, which is
a serendipitous, fun kind of

620
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,610
silly place, a place for
adventure and delight.

621
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:22,410
A place for potentially
education and news, but also a

622
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:26,280
place that is just as much a
library for everything that

623
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,720
you love in the world
in video, as well

624
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,970
as a place for fun.

625
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,270

626
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:36,460
TOM BROXTON: So to bring all of
that together, I guess what

627
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:40,710
we're trying to do is strive for
recognizability but not be

628
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:43,690
dogmatic about the consistency
for the sake of consistency.

629
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:48,120
We still want each platform
to take advantage of its

630
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,670
strengths s so that we can
get to a future that's

631
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:54,500
recognizably a consistent family
of products living off

632
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,700
this one service in the center
that's optimized for the

633
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,420
strengths and opportunities of
each, and really give people

634
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:04,330
the right content for the right
device at the right time

635
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:09,730
of day, lets them get in and get
out when they need to, and

636
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:13,500
remembers where they are
when they come back.

637
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,470
JOSH SASSOON: That's it.

638
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,720
Thank you.

639
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:23,220
[APPLAUSE]

640
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,080
TOM BROXTON: So we even left
a little bit of time for

641
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,020
questions if anybody has any.

642
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:30,010

643
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:34,630
And if not, there is a
page for feedback.

644
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:38,800
So if you want to give feedback,
you can scan the QR

645
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,360
code, or I think you can get
to it through the site.

646
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,850
And it's all gratefully
received.

647
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:43,810
Thank you.

648
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:45,420
JOSH SASSOON: Thank
you for coming.

649
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:49,280
AUDIENCE: Just one question
about the options you

650
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:54,590
presented earlier, the variants
of the teasers you

651
00:30:54,590 --> 00:31:02,000
put on the YouTube main page.

652
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,670
What's your criteria to say
if it's successful?

653
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:08,570
Is it just click-through rate?

654
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:12,670
Is it how long the user stays
after he clicks one video?

655
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:17,420
What's the main goal on this
first on the start?

656
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,270
TOM BROXTON: Do you
want me to start?

657
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,250
JOSH SASSOON: Sure.

658
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,990
TOM BROXTON: It varies from
exploration for exploration.

659
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,410
I mean, both of those
two things are very

660
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:26,570
interesting to us.

661
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:30,910
The immediate click-through
rate, the effect that changing

662
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:33,160
something on the site has, is
definitely interesting.

663
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,740
But also, of course, the longer
term, like does it lead

664
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,580
to longer number of clicks?

665
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,940
What are the kind of videos
that it leads to viewing?

666
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,940
How does that affect the
relationship of the viewer

667
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:46,690
with the creator of the
video behind it?

668
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:52,020
So I'd say that it's difficult
to think of one common thing.

669
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,750
But the common principle would
be to make sure that we

670
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:58,250
understand those in advance of
running the experiment, right?

671
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,890
It's far too easy to run an
experiment and then look at a

672
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:04,890
bunch of numbers and to try
and pick out the winner

673
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,080
afterwards.

674
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,200
JOSH SASSOON: I mean right now,
it's really hard to come

675
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,970
up with a good success metric,
because we're looking for

676
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,680
longer-term behavioral change.

677
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,330
We want people to come to the
Home page and make a better

678
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:18,520
decision instead of just
watching something and

679
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,090
abandoning it right away or
watching something that may

680
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:23,490
lead to some other series
of random watches.

681
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:26,300
We'd rather people get really
invested and understand what

682
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,710
they're watching and, depending
on the context,

683
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:32,920
watch it longer if they're in a
place like on a device where

684
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,600
there is the potential
to watch it longer.

685
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,710
Or at least have a high-quality
session where

686
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:39,365
they make it through the video
and they make a good decision.

687
00:32:39,365 --> 00:32:48,430

688
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:51,900
AUDIENCE: A question about the
dual-screen experience.

689
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,130
We haven't seen that.

690
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:56,290
How did you guys think about
basically designing a

691
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:58,690
dual-screen experience where
you use a tablet to control

692
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:01,080
what you see on a TV?

693
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,810
TOM BROXTON: I lost the end
of your question there.

694
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:05,080
As we've designed a dual-screen
experience--

695
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:05,340
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

696
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:10,150
How do you go after
designing it?

697
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:12,190
TOM BROXTON: Yeah, OK.

698
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:19,210
I think a lot of our initial
impulse is driven out of the

699
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:21,000
frustration we see
with search.

700
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,410
So if you look at our TV
experiences, you'll see the

701
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:28,880
dual-screen experience promoted
a lot from there,

702
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,030
because that's where we see
the biggest advantage for

703
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,700
people when they're having

704
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,790
frustration typing in controls.

705
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:39,930
So that's one of the places
where we started.

706
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:45,530
And then, the other part of
where it came from was really

707
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:49,240
thinking about, as I say, all
of the products working

708
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,126
together off a common service.

709
00:33:52,126 --> 00:33:55,720
So rather than trying to build
specific remote control apps,

710
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,650
as we'd seen other people do, we
were trying to think about

711
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:02,080
well, I really should be able
to search for my content

712
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,430
anywhere and play it anywhere.

713
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:07,690
So that was one of the
underlying principles of the

714
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:08,889
UI we were trying to develop.

715
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:12,260
And not develop new apps, but
think about, OK, we've already

716
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,179
got a mobile phone app.

717
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:14,670
And we've already
got a TV app.

718
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:17,469
What's the best way of
connecting these two together,

719
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:21,320
and how do I really want to
use these two things?

720
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,100
There's a sort of famous use
case for YouTube, right, that

721
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:29,239
we all know about where
everybody's got a video that

722
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,449
they want to show everybody.

723
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:34,330
And so everybody's waiting to
queue up and play their

724
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:36,949
favorite video, so that was sort
of one of the underlying

725
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:40,780
motivations was how do we
make that really easy.

726
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:43,239
So if we can all find that video
on our phone and play it

727
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,929
on the TV, that's a great win.

728
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:48,040

729
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,800
I'd say the difficulty is
balancing all of the different

730
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,969
use cases together that don't
always interact, the way that

731
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:57,360
use case works next to, oh, I've
just got a playlist that

732
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,800
I want to put up on the TV and
leave running during a party.

733
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,910
The two can be kind of in
conflict with each other.

734
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:13,220

735
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:18,410
AUDIENCE: So I wanted to ask,
when you're designing for

736
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:21,340
cross device, are you having
any of those devices drive

737
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,290
what the rest of the devices
are looking like?

738
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,830
Are you starting from the
phone and bringing it to

739
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:26,570
tablet elsewhere?

740
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:30,200
And then, do you feel like
you're compromising on some of

741
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,460
these devices because you're
trying to maintain

742
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,180
consistency?

743
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,980
Like, is this truly the best
tablet experience, or is it

744
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,890
the best that you can
do with consistency?

745
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:41,340
JOSH SASSOON: I mean, I came
from designing for desktop for

746
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,130
almost two years.

747
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:44,850
And so it's really easy to
fall into this pattern of

748
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:47,190
every feature exists on desktop,
so we're just going

749
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:51,030
to try and wedge it into mobile
or figure out how does

750
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:51,930
that work on TV.

751
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:55,580
And the reality is we just
make really concerted

752
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:59,770
decisions to constrain and say,
we just don't need to do

753
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:01,500
half of these things for
certain devices.

754
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,800
So we've really started to
reapproach some of our new

755
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,210
projects, from thinking
about, how does

756
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,360
this start with mobile?

757
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,710
How does it start
on the tablet?

758
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,920
How does it start on the TV?

759
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,410
And we're really starting to
think about desktop as an

760
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:15,230
equal instead of the first
thing we think about.

761
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:18,600
And so it's actually a pretty
interesting time for us right

762
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,470
now, because we're doing
all these explorations.

763
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:25,680
And granted, many of them
do start with desktop.

764
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,550
We're actually making sure that
we put mobile or tablet

765
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:31,370
on an equal playing field in
those explorations and say,

766
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:33,750
what do you actually really need
when you're staring at

767
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:34,250
your phone?

768
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:37,570
And 99% of the time, all the
things that we do on desktop

769
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:41,840
don't translate exactly or even

770
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,930
necessarily need to be there.

771
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:46,260
So again, as Tom said, we
think about familiarity.

772
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,780
We're not trying to just make
it absolutely consistent.

773
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,040
We just want to make sure that
when you're looking at your

774
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,090
phone and your desktop,
you feel like

775
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:53,900
you're using YouTube.

776
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,550
But the thing that you really
need from the phone is very

777
00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:00,310
different from what you need
on the desktop experience.

778
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:02,770
TOM BROXTON: I'd say just to add
to that that's definitely

779
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:05,000
part of the motivation that
was driving a lot of the

780
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,710
qualitative research that
we talked about.

781
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:09,870
Because I think it's
so easy to have an

782
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,200
assumption of knowledge.

783
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,040
We have so many learned patterns
from so many years of

784
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,650
building a very large website
that we wanted to really

785
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:21,410
immerse ourselves in the ways
of thinking of people using

786
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:22,500
other devices.

787
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,850
So that was part of the driver
behind that project.

788
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:28,840
AUDIENCE: So if you were going
to add a new capability into

789
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,240
the YouTube service, where
would you start?

790
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,400
Would you look across and say,
OK, I'm trying to design

791
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,790
simultaneously across
all of them?

792
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,720
Or do you have one where you
would start and then try to

793
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,280
loop it back around?

794
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,420
JOSH SASSOON: Some of the new
features, we're thinking right

795
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:45,570
away about how does it work
across platforms.

796
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,310
I mean, it's kind of
overwhelming, because we're

797
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:49,760
trying to do it all.

798
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,580
And we'll see how that works.

799
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,880
But I think a lot of the
explorations now start with

800
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,040
mobile, mobile and desktop.

801
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,320
And then, TV is kind of the
next thing we think about.

802
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:04,050

803
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:06,260
AUDIENCE: I just wanted to
touch on some of the user

804
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:10,660
research that you guys has been
doing around kind of how

805
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:15,920
people watch TV on a large,
10-foot experience.

806
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:21,120
Do you see the need to have
TV kind of be this like

807
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:28,520
painkiller/zoning out use case
dwindling with kind of

808
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,600
co-viewing applications and all
the research that shows

809
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,880
that people are just spending
increasingly large amount of

810
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,300
time actually doing stuff while
they're watching TV,

811
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,890
whether it's just being
on Facebook on

812
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:40,700
their phone or Twitter?

813
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:44,330
It just feels like less of a
relaxing use case, and I'm

814
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:49,030
just curious how that might
change your perception of what

815
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,380
it's about in that 10-foot
experience and how that

816
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,300
changes the UI.

817
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:52,680
TOM BROXTON: I agree.

818
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,040
And yeah, we're definitely
seeing this same pattern.

819
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,800
At the same time, the latest
research we're doing just

820
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,860
seems to suggest the TV's
on more and in a

821
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,180
more passive role.

822
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:10,300
The more it's used, at the same
time, the more we see the

823
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,710
two things going on together,
the less interactive and the

824
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,830
more background role the
TV seems to gain.

825
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:18,330

826
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:18,870
Yeah.

827
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:24,610
But then, I think that the
rise of these dual-screen

828
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:27,380
applications may change
that a lot.

829
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,680
I think they've got
a long way to go.

830
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:33,370
I was at CES earlier this year,
and just everybody's

831
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:35,360
throwing out these sort
of dual-screen apps.

832
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,630
And I think there's going to be
a kind of madness of them

833
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:38,910
for a while.

834
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:42,810
And so how that affects what's
appearing on the main screen

835
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:46,410
while we all play with our
iPods is interesting.

836
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:52,040
But I can't predict the pattern
yet of how that's

837
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,372
going to evolve.

838
00:39:53,372 --> 00:39:56,080

839
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,430
And I think we're running out of
time, so that might have to

840
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,590
be the last question.

841
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:02,270
Thank you all very
much for coming.

842
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:05,912
[APPLAUSE]
