[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:01:10,858 --> 00:01:11,910
PETE LEPAGE: All right.

3
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,180
Well, hello everybody.

4
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,670
And welcome to another Chrome
Apps Office Hours.

5
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,740
Today I'm joined by Mike Tsao,
who is joining me from

6
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,570
Mountain View.

7
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,740
Mike, do you want to
introduce yourself?

8
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,570
MIKE TSAO: Sure.

9
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:24,930
Thanks, Pete.

10
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:25,180
Hi.

11
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,340
My name's Mike Tsao.

12
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,400
I'm an engineer on the Chrome
Apps and Notifications team,

13
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,905
and I'm working on
notifications.

14
00:01:32,905 --> 00:01:34,230
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome.

15
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,170
So Mike's joining us today,
because he's been one of the

16
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,270
main guys who's been building
the new rich notification

17
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,220
system for Chrome apps.

18
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:46,370
If you've played with the WebKit
notifications or the

19
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:50,610
HTML5 notifications before in
Chrome and in other browsers,

20
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,230
you're somewhat familiar with
some of the notification stuff

21
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,580
that's available.

22
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,380
But the new notification system
really allows you to

23
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,890
provide much richer and, I
think, much more beautiful

24
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,550
notifications within
your application.

25
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:10,270
If we can switch over to my
screen for a sec so we can

26
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,390
have a look at a couple
of these.

27
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,090
So there's four different types
of notifications that

28
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,760
are available to users or
to you as a developer.

29
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,850
There's the basic notification,
which is just

30
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,290
simply an image and some text.

31
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,320
There's a simple notification,
which is, again, an

32
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,910
image and some text.

33
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,680
You can provide a little
bit more text on that.

34
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,080
And you can also provide
buttons.

35
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,280
I don't have any buttons shown
on the sample that I have on

36
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,610
screen right now.

37
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,160
The third type is an
image notification.

38
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,450
So you can pop up an image, so
that you can provide, hey,

39
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,650
maybe somebody has
added new photos.

40
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,460
You can think something similar
to what Google+ does

41
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,900
on an Android phone.

42
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,580
When there's a new image,
you see that

43
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,520
little bit of the image.

44
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,900
And finally, the fourth type
of notification is a list

45
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,880
notification.

46
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,310
This is really great for if
you have a whole bunch of

47
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,890
things that you need to tell the
user about, but you don't

48
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,530
want to put them all into
five or six different

49
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,760
notifications.

50
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,550
You can go in and put in
five different types.

51
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,330
And with the simple, the
image, and the list

52
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:24,470
notification, those
are all available.

53
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,450
You can add buttons to each of
those so that the user can

54
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,910
interact with each of those.

55
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:36,070
Right now, this stuff is under
the experimental API, but

56
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,800
that's changing.

57
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,310
Mike, you said you pushed
some of that stuff in

58
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,090
earlier this week.

59
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,710
So it should be going away?

60
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,270
MIKE TSAO: Yeah.

61
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:46,600
We have a change list that's
in flight right now that's

62
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,000
going to be taking us out of
experimental and into dev

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,200
channel only.

64
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,100
And what that means is that now
it'll be easier for you to

65
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,090
distribute your extension or
app to users who are on the

66
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:05,540
dev channel without making them
go through the hassle of

67
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,910
turning on the experimental
flag.

68
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,200
PETE LEPAGE: Perfect.

69
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,470
So once that goes away,
that's going to make

70
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,840
things a lot easier.

71
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,140
The demo that I'm going to show
you today, I'm running it

72
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,770
in Chromium.

73
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:21,430
Because right now this
only works on

74
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,450
Chrome OS and on Windows.

75
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,990
It's not available quite yet
on Mac, but it is coming.

76
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:30,070
It's something we're working on,
so we expect to see that

77
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,950
land in the near future.

78
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,420
So the rich notification
API, it's

79
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,980
chrome.notification.create.

80
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,940
And there's three parameters
it takes.

81
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:45,120
An ID, so that on any of the
callbacks, you know which

82
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,650
notification showed up.

83
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,430
There's options, which we'll
talk about in a sec, and

84
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:55,740
creation Callback, so the
callback that gets called once

85
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,000
the notification has shown up.

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,070
The object that you pass for
the notifications takes a

87
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,460
couple of different things.

88
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,120
So it takes the template type.

89
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,990
And all of this stuff is not
in the documentation yet.

90
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,420
We're a little bit ahead of
the documentation on this,

91
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,150
which I always think
is kind of fun.

92
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,730
So you can find some stuff here
as well, we'll put up in

93
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,660
a minute or two.

94
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,620
There's a blog post with
a little bit more.

95
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:29,000
So template type takes either
basic, simple, image, or list,

96
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,320
depending on what type of
notification you want to show,

97
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,140
the title, the message.

98
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,220
In some cases, you can have the
expanded message, which is

99
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:46,110
going to show up on the basic
notification, I believe.

100
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,600
The image URL.

101
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,660
So if you're going to have that
image pop up, you want to

102
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,280
provide the image URL
so it knows where to

103
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,790
grab the image from.

104
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:58,540
And if you're going to have a
list that items takes in an

105
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:02,760
array with the list of things
that you want to show up.

106
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,990
So it takes title and message.

107
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,310
You can also--

108
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,600
MIKE TSAO: One more thing
I'd like to point

109
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,730
out, Pete, if I may?

110
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,645
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, absolutely.

111
00:06:10,645 --> 00:06:17,940
MIKE TSAO: If you're using the
icon URL fields, then for a

112
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,160
packaged app, you're going to be
subject to content security

113
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,370
policy, CSP, versus if you're
using it in an extension, the

114
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,040
CSP is pretty lax there.

115
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,520
PETE LEPAGE: Right.

116
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:28,720
OK.

117
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,490
MIKE TSAO: One slightly
surprising behavior might be

118
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,310
that you're not able to just
head off to the open web and

119
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,440
grab an image from there to
display in your notifications.

120
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:44,350
So be aware of CSP for packaged
apps, and try to

121
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,110
avoid being surprised by that.

122
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:46,730
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

123
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,840
That's a really good point.

124
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,010
In fact, in the demo we'll show
in a sec, we've handled

125
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,820
that where the images
are there locally.

126
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,270
And I'll show you how we
did that in a sec.

127
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:03,640
And then there's a set of rich
notification events that you

128
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,980
can have as well.

129
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:11,320
So that when the notification is
shown, when it's closed, if

130
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,950
it's clicked, or if the user
clicks on a button, obviously,

131
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,670
you need to have a callback so
that you can handle each of

132
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,790
those particular things.

133
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:24,510
So with that, let's pop out of
here, and let's go have a look

134
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,510
at a real, live demo.

135
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,010
Lovely.

136
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,640
I always love it
when my virtual

137
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,970
machine locks up on me.

138
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:34,160

139
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,100
There we go.

140
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,500
All right.

141
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,940
So here we go.

142
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,940
I've got this running.

143
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,660
Like I said, it only
runs in Windows and

144
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,080
Chrome OS right now.

145
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,090
And unfortunately, I don't have
a Chrome OS set up in

146
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,625
canary or dev, but I'll get that
going hopefully in the

147
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,390
near future.

148
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,650
This notification--

149
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,850
if we can pop up the URL for the
sample app right now, this

150
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:58,350
is in the Chrome app sample.

151
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:01,740
So you can go and grab
this from the URL.

152
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,920
So the first letter there, that
says a zero, not an O. So

153
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,440
it's O, capital U--

154
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:09,840
Sorry.

155
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,610
Zero, capital U, small N,
capital U, capital V.

156
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,590
Somewhere that way.

157
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,330
Yeah.

158
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,970
Anyways, so here we go.

159
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,000
We've got this app.

160
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,690

161
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,700
If I click on this button, it's
going to show a simple

162
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,640
notification.

163
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,050
So sure enough, there's the
simple notification.

164
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,370
And you can see that
it's a simple

165
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,610
notification, just some text.

166
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,159
If I close this guy--

167
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,440
click on Close.

168
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,980
And instead of having a mail
icon, I want an Africa icon.

169
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,580
We can change the icon, the
image that shows up there, to

170
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,580
be whatever you want.

171
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:55,990
This app just has a couple of
predefined ones set up here.

172
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,000
Image notification.

173
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,340
You can see here we've got
a nice, big size image.

174
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,470
We've got the title.

175
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:06,430
You've got the text below it.

176
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,340
And a list notification.

177
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,550
So it shows up with
all of the things.

178
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,405
I'll close this guy, and
I'll add a button.

179
00:09:14,405 --> 00:09:17,010

180
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:22,460
Show a photo on G+.

181
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,770
So for example, I
could do this.

182
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:29,460
And sure enough, when the user
clicks on that, the event gets

183
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,990
called and you can open up
a window to whichever

184
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,950
application that you
want to happen.

185
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,800
So let's take a look
at the code for

186
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,010
how this guy is written.

187
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:46,970
And I'll bring up Sublime and
have a look at my main JS.

188
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,680
So one thing I want
to point out.

189
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,840
All of the code for this
application was written in the

190
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,470
actual app JavaScript file.

191
00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:00,180
But I think in a real
application, you're probably

192
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,410
not going to want to do that.

193
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:05,590
You're probably going to want to
put the notification events

194
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,825
and notification handlers and
all that kind of stuff into

195
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:12,240
the app JS or into
the main JS file.

196
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,160
And the reason why I say that
is because if you want a

197
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,290
notification to pop up, you
probably want the notification

198
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:23,180
to pop up when the application
maybe isn't running, when

199
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,570
certain events happen.

200
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:29,090
Or if the app is already
running, the user's already

201
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,070
probably in it and using it.

202
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,490
But you want to be able to pop
those notifications up even if

203
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:37,920
the user's not running
the application.

204
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,670
So by putting the events and the
handlers into your main JS

205
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,970
file, you can listen for alarms,
you can put some of

206
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,070
your background processing
script in there.

207
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:54,360
So that way, things are running
as you'd expect.

208
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,450
So let's have a quick peek at
what's going on in this

209
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,420
application.

210
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:05,290
So the way that we wrote this
here is all of the images that

211
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:09,920
are possible that you can have
in the array list, so as you

212
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,110
pop up that particular
notification.

213
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,320
We've got that.

214
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,190
And then in this particular
case, just because we wanted

215
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,150
to be able to show the
different types of

216
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:22,940
notifications, we created a set
of objects that have each

217
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,890
of the different
set of options.

218
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,610
You can see here, here's the
list with title list

219
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:36,410
notification, a message, and
then each of the list items.

220
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,330
And then we add our
Event Listeners.

221
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,290
So go in.

222
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:45,050
On our page load, we say,
Chrome experimental

223
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,080
notification on display.

224
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,410
Add Listener.

225
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:55,600
And our callback is the
notification displayed.

226
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,090
So when the user runs this, we
call the Do Notify event.

227
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:04,170
So on any of the clicks to any
of the events, we go in,

228
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:09,210
figure out which element or
which button they clicked on.

229
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:13,150
Now, we talked about-- and Mike
mentioned this earlier.

230
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:16,000
Making sure that your image
comes from your local file

231
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,780
system, so that you're not hit
by any of the CSP things.

232
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:26,090
So here in our image URL, we
say, chrome.runtime.geturl.

233
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:33,150
And we provide the URL to
the particular image.

234
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,490
So that way, it's going
to give us that

235
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:37,290
fully-qualified URL.

236
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,550
So that way, when it goes to
grab that image, we pull it

237
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,940
from our local file system.

238
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,800
We're all good to go.

239
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,980
We don't have to worry about,
hey, where did that image come

240
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,310
from, what are the CSP rules.

241
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:52,670
We know that we're getting the
image from the right place.

242
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:57,070
And then finally, on our
options.button, we can go in

243
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:02,190
and say, buttons and push the
two buttons into the array

244
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,790
lists if there are
two buttons.

245
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,600
Or maybe we only just
need one button.

246
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,170
And then finally,
chrome.notifcation.create.

247
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:14,690
In this particular case, we're
just using a simple ID based

248
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:15,290
on the number.

249
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:19,220
But you can use whatever
you want in here.

250
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,060
We pass it our options and
our create Callback.

251
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,970
So it's a pretty simple thing
to go and create these

252
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,400
notifications.

253
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,720
We've got our callback
handlers that

254
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,820
show each of the events.

255
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,250
So actually, I'm going to
pop back over to our

256
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,130
sample here for a sec.

257
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:43,460
And if I go in and Inspect
Element, so that we can see

258
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:47,410
what's happening in the console,
you can see all of

259
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,870
the different events that
happened in here.

260
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,360
And we can see, oh, notification
ID was closed.

261
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,060
Notification ID1 was displayed
to the user.

262
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:02,620
So if I add an image
notification and I click on

263
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:06,280
this button, if we go down
here to the very bottom,

264
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,510
notification ID14 was
successfully created and our

265
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:14,900
notification button
0 was clicked.

266
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:19,530
So it's a relatively easy way
to be able to go and pop up

267
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:22,950
notifications and tell
the user about things

268
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,430
that are going on.

269
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:28,350
So we just put up on screen
the link to questions.

270
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:32,120
So if you have questions about
these notifications or how you

271
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,790
can use these notifications in
your app or where to expect

272
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,230
these, go post your questions
in Moderator, and we'll take

273
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:43,220
them here in just about
two minutes or so.

274
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,470
So like I said, getting
this to run is a

275
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,670
relatively simple process.

276
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:50,890
There are, I believe--

277
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,530
Let's just double-check
on this.

278
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,590
I don't believe you need--

279
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,780
Actually, maybe Mike, you
can tell me while I

280
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:00,400
try to look it up.

281
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,980
Does the application need any
particular permissions to be

282
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,715
able to use these?

283
00:15:05,715 --> 00:15:08,170
MIKE TSAO: Yes.

284
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,930
At this moment, you're going
to need the experimental

285
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,320
permission, because it's
an experimental API.

286
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,670
When we leave experimental,
it's going to require the

287
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,510
notification permission.

288
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:25,360
And this is not a very noisy
permission in the sense that

289
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,720
it's the kind of thing that will
scare away your users.

290
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,060
It's pretty straightforward
stuff, but you will need that.

291
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,530
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

292
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,490
All right.

293
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,590
Well, let's pop over
to questions.

294
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:40,760
If we can bring the question
URL back up.

295
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,330
It looks like I have lost my
internet connection, which is

296
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,720
always a little bit of fun.

297
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,700

298
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,890
Oh, there we go.

299
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:50,230
All right.

300
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:54,870
So you can post your
questions in there.

301
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:59,030
There are no questions
yet, but that's OK.

302
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,830
One of the things that I think
is really exciting about this

303
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:05,920
is it really does provide an
easy way for developers to be

304
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,970
able to alert people about stuff
that's going on within

305
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:09,810
their apps.

306
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,810
And your apps don't necessarily

307
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,730
always have to be running.

308
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:18,910
If you put the handler for this
inside the main JS file

309
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:22,980
or inside your background script
and you handle things

310
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:27,580
like maybe you're listening for
new data that gets posted

311
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,460
to a server.

312
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:33,980
Maybe you're using the Alarms
API and you want to pop a

313
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,720
notification up that reminds the
user that, hey, it's maybe

314
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,340
time to take your medication
or hey, you haven't been to

315
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,190
the gym today, you should
go to the gym.

316
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:45,920
That would be a great little
thing that Fit Better, any of

317
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:52,290
those fitness applications
went in and used.

318
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:55,410
So I think with that, it looks
like there aren't too many

319
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,490
questions today.

320
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,398
So Mike, do you have anything
that you want to add?

321
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:04,930
MIKE TSAO: Well, we're really
excited about this API.

322
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:09,109
And particularly visually, it's
turned out really nicely.

323
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:11,050
And we're happy about that.

324
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,560

325
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,849
And it's a super simple
API to use.

326
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:19,760
We're going to be adding more
templates in the future to

327
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,785
cover different use cases.

328
00:17:20,785 --> 00:17:21,369
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, awesome.

329
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:24,560
MIKE TSAO: So now is really the
time for people to get in

330
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,329
there and give it a try and make
sure that we've covered

331
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:29,690
every use case that
we can think of.

332
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:34,650
If there is a particular
template or layout that you're

333
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:38,070
really wanting, then this is a
great time to suggest that.

334
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:42,970
And we'll get our UX and UI
folks working on it to make it

335
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,112
look gorgeous for you.

336
00:17:44,112 --> 00:17:44,540
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

337
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,310
That's great.

338
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:48,740
So for those of you who do want
your own templates and

339
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:54,200
want to provide, go file a bug
on CR Bug, Chromium Bugs.

340
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,370
And let us know about
it, so that we know.

341
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,960
And then get your friends to
go and star those bugs, so

342
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,470
that we see that there's
a lot of community

343
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,500
interest behind that.

344
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,010
Cool.

345
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,920
Well, Mike, thanks
for joining me.
