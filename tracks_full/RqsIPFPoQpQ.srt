1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,210

2
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,570
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: So good
afternoon, everybody.

3
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,560
I'd like to welcome you
to this session.

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,900
My name is Prakash Hariramani.

5
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,370
I'm a senior product
manager at Google.

6
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,120
With me is Michael Galpin.

7
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,120
He's the technical lead for a
very exciting product we're

8
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,650
going to be announcing today.

9
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:18,240
And I'm also honored to have
Jonathan Taylor, who is VP of

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,700
mobile at Priceline.

11
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,360
And he is going to be talking
about something

12
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,820
very exciting, too.

13
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,380
So we are very happy because
we are able to announce a

14
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,970
great product for mobile
commerce today called Google

15
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,610
Wallet Instant Buy.

16
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:37,220
And as you'll see, it's going to
help your users, consumers

17
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,880
be able to buy physical
goods and services in

18
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,720
a much easier way.

19
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,050
So before we get into the
product details, we thought we

20
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,900
should look at things
in perspective.

21
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,280
Today, when we look at a rotary
dial phone, we laugh,

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,000
especially when we have our
nice, shiny Android devices

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
next to us.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,860
And we believe that the state of
mobile commerce today when

25
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,350
we take a step back maybe in
the future and look back to

26
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,940
where we are today, that's
how we'll look at

27
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,020
the state of mCommerce.

28
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,890
So what is the state
of mCommerce today?

29
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:15,260
Unfortunately, it's a
very painful state.

30
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,420
For many of you who have tried
to make a purchase on a mobile

31
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,080
device, the average person goes
through 24 plus steps

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,880
because you have to enter your
billing information.

33
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,730
And, god forbid, if you're
shipping information is

34
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,680
different from your billing
information, you have to enter

35
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,920
more keystrokes.

36
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,390
And then not to mention that
many sites require you to set

37
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,180
up a username and password,
log in.

38
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,350
And then you add all these steps
up, you could easily

39
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:46,990
have 100 keystrokes, friction,
which leads to abandonment,

40
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,730
which means you don't have
high conversion rates.

41
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:53,570
And one of the stats that's
staggering is the purchase

42
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,070
abandonment rate with
mobile commerce.

43
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:03,830
So 97% percent of users abandon
a purchase midstream.

44
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,480
And just to, again, take a step
back, mobile commerce is

45
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,259
growing at 100% year
over year.

46
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,830
So the question we ask ourselves
is, how much more

47
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,030
could this market be growing if
we were able to reduce or

48
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,720
eliminate this friction?

49
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,850
And that's where Google Wallet
Instant Buy comes in.

50
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,860
So how are we addressing
this pain point?

51
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,150
So there's a couple
of ways we're

52
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,020
addressing this pain point.

53
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,650
One is we want to have faster
checkout for physical goods

54
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,070
and services.

55
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:33,330
So as many of you know, by
virtue of having an Android

56
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,890
phone, you have Android Play on
it, the Android Play Store.

57
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,720
And many of you have, hopefully,
made a purchase on

58
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,880
Android Play.

59
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,030
By virtue of making that
purchase, you've set up a

60
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,190
Google Wallet.

61
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,880
And now that you already have
the Google Wallet set up, you

62
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,400
can use that same wallet for
making a purchase of physical

63
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,210
goods and services or,
for example, buying

64
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,730
something on Priceline.

65
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:00,040
So we reduce one friction pain
point, which is removing the

66
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,560
pain of entering your billing
and payment information.

67
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,920
The other pain point
we covered was

68
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,450
registration and login.

69
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,580
And I think many of you
may have attended

70
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,590
the G+ sessions already.

71
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,710
That's a great way to remove
this pain point.

72
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:18,810
Not only can you avoid the users
from having to set up a

73
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,490
different username and password,
we can also share

74
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,290
profile information, so
you can make it a more

75
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,740
personalized experience when
a user comes in to log in.

76
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,690
So speed is everything in
mCommerce And I think,

77
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,260
hopefully, you are getting
the message.

78
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,470
If you do step 1 and 2, you make
checkout fast and easy.

79
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,870
And it's all about speed when it
comes to mCommerce Security

80
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,280
is something that we are
very passionate about.

81
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,520
And there's one traditional
misconception out there that

82
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,530
security and convenience
are a zero-sum game.

83
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,290
We think that's a
false choice.

84
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,920
We think you can raise the
bar on both security and

85
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,890
convenience.

86
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,720
And we have done that with
Google Wallet Instant Buy.

87
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,040
So what are we doing
about security?

88
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,430
We did a couple things.

89
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,410
One is, every time you make
a purchase, we generate a

90
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,620
one-time virtual card.

91
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,560
This other thing we do is we
have a Google Wallet Purchase

92
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,820
Protection Program.

93
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,690
So your users, your consumers
of your application, have a

94
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,640
peace of mind that any
unauthorized purchase is

95
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,690
something they don't need
to worry about.

96
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,420
And most importantly, we have
risk-based authentication.

97
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,310
So when you have an Android
device, you're already logged

98
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,550
into the device.

99
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,980
We don't ask you to enter your
username and password.

100
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,290
But we do have a very
sophisticated risk engine that

101
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:38,700
will challenge your user if
it gets a risk signal.

102
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,650
There's two other points which
I'll just touch on, but

103
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,050
Michael's going to cover in
more detail, which relate

104
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,140
around lightweight
integration.

105
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,620
And the reason for that is
because our integration is

106
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,340
client-to-client, so
there's no back-end

107
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,990
elongated server process.

108
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,180
But you don't have to
take my word for it.

109
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,140
Jonathan and team and the other
launch partners, you can

110
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:58,880
talk to them directly.

111
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,730
And they'll talk about
their experience.

112
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:05,060
And finally, we don't charge
any additional fees.

113
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,530
If you use Google Wallet, you
continue to use your existing

114
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,980
payment processor.

115
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,410
Google doesn't charge
any additional

116
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,660
fees on top of that.

117
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,280

118
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,910
So how does the product work?

119
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,500
So this is actually from
our sample application.

120
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,980
And for those of you who will
use our SDK will also get the

121
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,130
source code for the sample
application.

122
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,190
So the typical purchase process
starts with the screen

123
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,020
on the left.

124
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,520
So I go to Checkout.

125
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,470
And I've chosen what I want
to buy, it's a Cannon.

126
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,800
I'm going to invoke the Buy
With Google Wallet button.

127
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,610
So typically, you would place
the Buy With Google Wallet

128
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,540
button at Checkout.

129
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,830
And when I do that, it
brings up the middle

130
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,990
screen that you see.

131
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,830
It's what we called
the Chooser.

132
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,180
This is the Google Wallet
Instant Buy Chooser.

133
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,910
So I mentioned earlier to you
all that if you've used Play,

134
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,670
by virtue of using that, you've
set up an account, a

135
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,940
Google Wallet account.

136
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,340
So let's say, I set up a Google
Wallet account and I

137
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,460
had MasterCard as my funding
instrument or what we call

138
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,060
your backing card, that's
what's going to show up.

139
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,930
That's the MasterCard you see
where it says Pay To.

140
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,200
You can change it to another
source, if you want.

141
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,500
It also has my shipping
address below.

142
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,340
So because it already got this
from my Play account, I don't

143
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,080
have to go through the
frictional pain point of

144
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,390
entering it again.

145
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:24,060
I also want to draw your
attention to the check box.

146
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,180
This is what we call
pre-authorization.

147
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,730
This is very important because
if your user checks this box

148
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:34,010
and gives consent, next time
when that same user comes back

149
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,770
to your application, they
can skip the screen.

150
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:40,440
So it makes it a 2-tap
purchase process.

151
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,360
Once the Chooser comes up after
the user gives consent,

152
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,390
we pass control back to your
site, which is the

153
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,640
screen on the right.

154
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,680

155
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,315
We also do what's called
a Masked Wallet.

156
00:06:51,315 --> 00:06:53,530
So essentially, we pass to you
the last four digits of the

157
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:57,400
funding instrument, which is the
MasterCard ending in 5417,

158
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,980
and the shipping address.

159
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,440
And as far as you're concerned
as a developer or merchant,

160
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,610
it's as if the user
had typed it in.

161
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,900
When the user hits Confirm
Order, then we pass what's

162
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,750
called a Full Wallet, which
has that one time virtual

163
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,430
MasterCard I talked about.

164
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,480
And the beauty about this is
you don't have to make any

165
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,270
changes downstream from your
payment processing

166
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:18,950
perspective.

167
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:22,400
What I mean by that is it's as
if I had typed a MasterCard in

168
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,110
a mobile commerce site.

169
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,320
So again, it's very powerful
because it goes back to

170
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,570
lightweight integration.

171
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,320

172
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,130
So we thought it would be good
if we could have Jonathan now

173
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:37,400
demonstrate what I've been
talking about and give a demo

174
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,800
of Priceline and talk about
his experience integrating

175
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,770
with Instant Buy.

176
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,680
Jonathan, over to you.

177
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,680
JONATHAN TAYLOR: OK, Prakash,
thanks very much.

178
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,890
We'll switch over to the wolf.

179
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:50,150
Well, at Priceline, we are all
about bringing great travel

180
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,390
deals to our customers.

181
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,150
And we're especially interested
in making it fast

182
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,440
and easy for our customers to
book a great hotel room at a

183
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,710
great rate from their
mobile device.

184
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,820
Now, as Prakash mentions,
speed is everything.

185
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,000
Speed always wins.

186
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,140
And this is a very important
differentiator for us.

187
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,100
We want to make it as quick
and easy to check out on

188
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,540
Priceline with the Android
app as we can.

189
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:16,100
So we have teamed up with Google
to introduce a Full

190
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,540
Google Wallet integration
into our Android app.

191
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,390
And I'll give you an example
of how that works.

192
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,310
But first, I'll say that a wise
man once gave me some

193
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:29,370
advice, which is, Jonathan,
never do a live demo on a

194
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,590
wireless network.

195
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:35,450
So with that sage advice in
mind, we will do a live demo

196
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,280
on a wireless network.

197
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,100
[LAUGHTER]

198
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,590
JONATHAN TAYLOR: So let's
imagine that I'm a brand-new

199
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,690
Priceline customer.

200
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,620
I've just downloaded and
installed the brand-new

201
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,780
Priceline app, which we've just
released today from the

202
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,280
Play Store.

203
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,680
And I'll bring it up.

204
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,930
And I had this idea that since
we have this great spring

205
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,760
weather here on the West Coast,
I'll extend my vacation

206
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,370
a little bit and book a great
hotel room down the coast in

207
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,620
Monterey this weekend.

208
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,340
So we'll choose the
Hotel section from

209
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,050
the Priceline app.

210
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,490
Rather than San Francisco, we'll
choose Monterey, which

211
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,400
we've recently chosen.

212
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,500
And we'll check in on Saturday
the 18th and

213
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,800
check out on the 19th.

214
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,300
We'll choose one room and
do a search for that.

215
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,450
So let's see what's available
in Monterey this weekend.

216
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,290
The Priceline app is searching
for all the available rooms

217
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:24,275
and rates among all the
available hotels in Monterey.

218
00:09:24,275 --> 00:09:33,510

219
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,970
And hopefully, we'll have
the results shortly.

220
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:39,780

221
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,600
Here we go.

222
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,770
A couple of good
choices there.

223
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,855
I think we'll pick the Hyatt
Regency Monterey.

224
00:09:44,855 --> 00:09:47,550

225
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,770
We can browse through
the hotel amenities,

226
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,090
look at some pictures.

227
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,940
We can look at guest reviews and
just get a general idea of

228
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,190
what the hotel looks like.

229
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:08,940

230
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,850
And this is the normal checkout
flow for hotel.

231
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,850
And again, I'm a first-time
customer.

232
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:17,530
So I have not yet chosen my
Google Sign-in or my Google

233
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,036
Wallet method of payment.

234
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:24,500

235
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,115
We may need to switch
wireless networks.

236
00:10:26,115 --> 00:10:30,910

237
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:31,730
Here we go.

238
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,460
No, we didn't quite make it.

239
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,780
Let me take this off
for a second and

240
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,030
we'll switch networks.

241
00:10:37,030 --> 00:11:14,050

242
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,400
Almost there.

243
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,650
And there we go.

244
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:22,050

245
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,110
That looks a little
bit better.

246
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,360
The orientation, right?

247
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,910

248
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,830
And we have the details
on our selection.

249
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:33,350
So we'll choose Book Now.

250
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:36,440
We'll choose a great room,
coming up here, a king bed.

251
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,090
And we have a brand-new option
in our checkout options now,

252
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,670
which is a Sign-in
with Google.

253
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,860
So this is the Google single
sign-on option.

254
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,610
We choose Sign-in with Google.

255
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:49,160
And immediately, we'll be asked
to have the app-granted

256
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,480
permission do a couple things
in our Google profile--

257
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,160
access to the Wallet information
and access to the

258
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,460
basic profile information.

259
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,390
We'll say OK for that.

260
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,510
And what will happen is it will
choose Google Wallet as

261
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,850
our default method
of payment now.

262
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,250
And this is the regular Google
Wallet payment selector, which

263
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,080
Mike will talk about
in a minute.

264
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,060
And very importantly, we're
going to choose the box that

265
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,730
Prakash mentioned, which is to
use Google Wallet to pay for

266
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,740
future purchases.

267
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,740
So the number of taps the next
time through the application

268
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,400
is greatly diminished.

269
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,860
We'll say OK for that.

270
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,560
And right away, we have our
summary of charges, we have

271
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,300
our payment method as Google
Wallet is preselected.

272
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,920
It's copied the payment
information and billing

273
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,730
information from the wallet.

274
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:34,000
And we can go ahead
and book now.

275
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,540
We have just done our first
Priceline hotel booking using

276
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,940
Google Wallet.

277
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,500
Now, the good news is that
I'm a repeat customer.

278
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,440
And I come back through the
application the second time.

279
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,220
The number of taps required to
check out is even less because

280
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,430
I've signed in with Google,
which is sticky.

281
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,310
And I've chosen Google
Wallet as my

282
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,290
default method of payment.

283
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,990
So then I come back through
the app and decide to book

284
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,570
maybe another weekend
in Monterey.

285
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,470
I'll show you how much faster
it is the second time,

286
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,540
especially now that we have
a great Wi-Fi network

287
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,790
[CHUCKLES].

288
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:10,050

289
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,305
Again, we'll choose our hotel
from the available hotels.

290
00:13:12,305 --> 00:13:21,580

291
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,385
Let's try the Casa Munras.

292
00:13:25,385 --> 00:13:26,440
We'll say Book Now.

293
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,380
And again, we'll choose our best
rate available or choose

294
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,330
a room and rate combination
that we like.

295
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:37,710

296
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:42,320
We'll choose this Queen Room.

297
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,710
And this time through, we go
directly into Google Wallet

298
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,140
because we're signed in to
Google, we've chosen Google

299
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,820
Wallet as our method
of payment.

300
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,470
And immediately, we have our
payment method selected.

301
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,070
All we need to do
is say Book Now.

302
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,840
We've made our second booking
on Priceline.

303
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,570
This time, much faster.

304
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,570
So we've greatly improved
the checkout flow

305
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:59,810
for Priceline customers.

306
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:05,400
[APPLAUSE]

307
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,780
JONATHAN TAYLOR: Now, the good
news is that the points of

308
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,870
integration from the app to the
Google Play services are

309
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,970
pretty straightforward.

310
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:14,440
And as Prakash mentioned, our
payment back-end systems are

311
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,530
changed very little because we
actually have a full-fledged

312
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,840
card number to pass
through to it.

313
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,930
And Mike will talk a little bit
more about the details of

314
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:22,220
integration.

315
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,660
But now, I'll turn it back
over to Prakash.

316
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,240
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: Thank
you, Jonathan.

317
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,930
That was great.

318
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,170
I should have mentioned this
earlier, but if you see

319
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,780
anything that excites you, feel
free to applaud at any

320
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,640
point in this presentation.

321
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,520
[LAUGHTER]

322
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,540
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: So with
that, on the spirit of

323
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,240
applause, I think we
need to applaud

324
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,150
all our launch partners.

325
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,320
We are very grateful.

326
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,990
We have a great roster of
partners who have launched

327
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,830
Google Wallet Instant Buy.

328
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,460
And just to make a shameless
plug, we have a blog post that

329
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,790
was released at noon.

330
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:54,090
And you will be able to test
those applications out.

331
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:57,040
So the partners we have launched
with today are

332
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:04,630
Airbnb, Expedia, FANCY, GIGYA,
GoPago, NFC Task 10,

333
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:08,840
Priceline, of course, Rue La
La, Booking.com, Tabbedout,

334
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,510
Uber, and Wrapp.

335
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,450
What I'd really encourage
everybody to do is download

336
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,730
these apps and experience
the great

337
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,790
mCommerce experience yourself.

338
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:21,240
So for example, if you haven't
made vacation plans for

339
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,980
summer, I'd encourage you to try
out Priceline and make a

340
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,880
booking just like
Jonathan did.

341
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,930
We have a slew of other
travel partners, too.

342
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:32,750
If you want to try a local San
Francisco eatery, Bistro

343
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,640
Burger, I'd encourage you
to download GoPago.

344
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,520
Install it and order ahead.

345
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,570
I'd also encourage you to--

346
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:44,250
when you go to some of the
after-session festivities

347
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,540
they've organized--

348
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,700
call Uber for a cab ride so
you can drive home safely.

349
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,150
The other thing I want to
emphasize is we have many of

350
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,220
these partners in the Google
Wallet Sandbox area.

351
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,140
So I'd really encourage
everybody to show up there if

352
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,060
you're interested in this
product and talk to the

353
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,550
developers and partners
directly.

354
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,380
So with that, I'm going to turn
this over to Michael, who

355
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,960
is going to walk you through the
rest of the presentation.

356
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,080
MICHAEL GALPIN: Thanks,
Prakash.

357
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,070
No more demos, I swear.

358
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,010
It's really humbling to see
the list of partners out

359
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:21,210
there, a lot of great apps
using our software.

360
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:24,410
Hopefully, after you saw the
Priceline demo, you'll agree

361
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,650
it's a great experience
for your customers.

362
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,350
But you, guys, are developers.

363
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:31,450
You, guys, want to know
how this works.

364
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,700
So let's take a look.

365
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,050

366
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:38,030
So this is the Instant
Buy flow.

367
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,130
And you'll notice there's a fork
at the top of this flow

368
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,300
chart here.

369
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,380
And that corresponds to the
first time versus subsequent

370
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:51,690
times a user uses Instant
Buy in your application.

371
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,300
There's four steps involved.

372
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,270
The first is getting
a Masked Wallet.

373
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,050
As Prakash mentioned earlier,
a Masked Wallet is just a

374
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:02,260
description of the payment
instrument the user's going to

375
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,300
use for the transaction.

376
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,470
So if you use something, like
MasterCard 1234, so the last

377
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:11,089
four digits, just enough
information for the user to

378
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:13,390
identify the instrument.

379
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:16,890
But it's not the full
16 digits to it.

380
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:20,170
And it also includes
a shipping address.

381
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:23,540
So when you get a Masked Wallet,
the first time a user

382
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,579
uses Instant Buy with your
application, you're going to

383
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:27,940
need to show the
Instant Buy UI.

384
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:32,110
So that's the right side
of the fork here.

385
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:35,250
That's the Chooser UI that
you saw earlier.

386
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,460
It shows the given instruments
the user has.

387
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,030
So if they've bought something
on Google Play, maybe they

388
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:44,740
bought an app, you'll see
the credit card there.

389
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,360
If they've bought a Nexus 7,
you'll see the shipping

390
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,740
address that they shipped it
to will be listed there.

391
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,760
So they can select what they
want to use there.

392
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,090
And then you'll be given
the Masked Wallet data.

393
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:00,560
And with that, you want
to update your UI.

394
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,040
The first thing you probably
want to do is calculate the

395
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,225
sales tax, calculate the
shipping costs, and show that

396
00:18:06,225 --> 00:18:07,900
to your user.

397
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,320
You probably also want to show
the Masked Wallet information

398
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,620
to the user so they know, OK,
it's this card that's going to

399
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,270
get charged, it's this
address where things

400
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,790
are going to be sent.

401
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,290
Once they're happy with it,
then they can confirm the

402
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,240
transaction.

403
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,050
And that's when you
get a Full Wallet.

404
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,940
That Full Wallet is just like
a Masked Wallet, but it also

405
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,350
includes this generated virtual
card that you can then

406
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:31,400
turn around, send to your
back-end systems for payment

407
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,650
processing.

408
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,590

409
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:38,850
So we'll go into some more
detail in these steps here.

410
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,250
I was really hoping Jonathan
would give us the source code

411
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,750
to Priceline, and we could
look at some of that.

412
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,235
But instead, we'll have to
settle for our sample app.

413
00:18:47,235 --> 00:18:50,630
As Prakash mentioned earlier,
it's a sample application, all

414
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,440
the source code comes
with the SDK.

415
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,580
So you, guys, can take
a look at it.

416
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,920
On this screen, the only thing
you see going on is this Buy

417
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,620
With Google button.

418
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,660
It's important for your
users to see that.

419
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,540
It lets them know that, hey,
I'm going to use Google to

420
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,590
complete this purchase.

421
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,640
It's very reassuring to them.

422
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,350
But behind the scenes, there's
even more going on.

423
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,460
Behind the scenes, the
application is establishing a

424
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,780
connection to Instant Buy.

425
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,020
Now, that sounds kind
of strange.

426
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,370
So maybe you might want
to know what's

427
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,620
going on with that.

428
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,730
Well, to understand that, let's
look at the Instant Buy

429
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,430
architecture.

430
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:29,390
Instant Buy is a component
of Google Play Services.

431
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,090
You might have heard about
Google Play Services earlier

432
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:34,620
today in the keynote.

433
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,330
It's been out for
almost a year.

434
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:39,630
So you might have, actually,
already be using it.

435
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:45,180
Its a push to all Android
devices running 4EO or higher.

436
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:48,220
That includes all those
Gingerbread devices.

437
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,300
And they have the Play Store.

438
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,820
To integrate with Instant Buy,
all you have to do is compile

439
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:58,190
in the Play Services client
library into your application.

440
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:03,240
That client library is a very
thin client library.

441
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,980
The bulk of the code is part
of the Play Services APK,

442
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,570
which runs in a separate
process.

443
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:10,090
And it's because it's running
in a separate process is why

444
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,750
you have to create this
connection between your

445
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,125
application and the Play
Services process.

446
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:17,530

447
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:20,740
So creating that connection,
it's pretty straightforward.

448
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,420
First, you want to create an
instance of WalletClient.

449
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:26,410
This is really the main entry
point into Instant Buy.

450
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:29,420
It's the object that has all the
APIs you are going to use.

451
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,750
Creating one is pretty
straightforward.

452
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,110
You pass on an activity
through it.

453
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,360
You pass on the constants
[INAUDIBLE]

454
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,700
environment.

455
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,950
We have a test environment we
call Sandbox where you can use

456
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,760
fake credit card numbers,
so you can test all your

457
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,646
integration without actually
having to spend money.

458
00:20:44,646 --> 00:20:48,900
You can specify an account that
ties into single sign-on,

459
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,400
which we mentioned earlier.

460
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,280
And I'll go into more
detail soon.

461
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,930
And a couple of callbacks.

462
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:56,750
The first is this connection
callback, which is going to

463
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,160
receive life cycle events for
your connection to the Play

464
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,500
Services APK.

465
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,950
So it's going to receive events,
like onConnected or

466
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,240
onDisconnected.

467
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,460
And finally, there's
a FailureListener.

468
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,540
If for some reason, you can't
establish the connection, that

469
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,580
listener gets notified
of that.

470
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,340
Once you've created the instance
of the WalletClient,

471
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,980
then you just call connect.

472
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,250
That's an asynchronous call,
just like all the other APIs

473
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,500
in Instant Buy.

474
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,220

475
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,170
So now, you're ready to
get a Masked Wallet.

476
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,960
There's a few things you need
to figure out before you

477
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,930
request a Masked Wallet.

478
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,490
Do you need a full
billing address?

479
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,815
Do you need a shipping
address?

480
00:21:33,815 --> 00:21:35,900
Do you need the user's
phone number?

481
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,200
We really wanted to make Instant
Buy fit in with your

482
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,210
existing checkout flow.

483
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,870
So if you ask for a full billing
address, then you tell

484
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,620
Instant Buy you need a
full billing address.

485
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,520
If you only ask for a minimal
billing address-- so

486
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,970
basically, just a zip code of
their billing address--

487
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,580
then you can tell Instant
Buy that.

488
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,220
And that's all we'll ask
the user for as well.

489
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,330

490
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:00,550
So once you got all these
things figured out, then

491
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,700
you're ready to create a request
for a Masked Wallet.

492
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,870
So when you want to do that
is when your connection

493
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:10,980
callback's onConnected
method gets invoked.

494
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,160
That tells you that the
connections have been

495
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,315
established with Instant Buy.

496
00:22:13,315 --> 00:22:15,460
And it's safe to call
other APIs.

497
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,170

498
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,700
So to build your
MaskedWalletRequest, we have a

499
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,770
very convenient builder
you can use.

500
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,710
And this is just where you
set all the options.

501
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,770
Like here, I'm saying I need
a shipping address.

502
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:29,750

503
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,470
When you want to set your
options, you call .build, and

504
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:34,330
you got a request ready to go.

505
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,630
You take that request and you
call the loadMaskedWallet

506
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:39,310
method on the wallet client.

507
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,970
You also pass a listener
to this.

508
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:44,960
This API dimension, like all the
others, is asynchronous.

509
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,850
So you pass a listener, that
gets invoked once, the data's

510
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,400
returned back from Google.

511
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,310

512
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:56,620
At this point, the first-time
users use Instant Buy in your

513
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:00,250
application, you need to show
the Instant Buy UI.

514
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,150
You're going to get a callback
here that will receive a

515
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,760
ConnectionResult.

516
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,860
If you happen to have used any
of the other parts of a Google

517
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,340
Play Services, that
ConnectionResult object should

518
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:12,380
be familiar to you already as
it's used through all the

519
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,430
different components.

520
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:17,110
It basically has a success
or failure method.

521
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:20,240
And in our case, success means
you've got data as a response

522
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,580
to the request you made.

523
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,130
And there's no UI to show.

524
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:26,560
So that corresponds to the
pre-authorization case for the

525
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,820
subsequent times a user uses
Instant Buy in your

526
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,410
application.

527
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,260
Failure, while that sounds kind
of harsh, it just means

528
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,890
that we couldn't return
the data to you yet.

529
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,770
You need to show the
Instant Buy UI.

530
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:40,810
To show the Instant Buy UI, we
rely on the startActivityFor

531
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:45,140
Result/onActivityResult
paradigm.

532
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,650
It's very common in Android
development.

533
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:50,970

534
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:55,030
To show the Instant Buy UI,
the listener you passed

535
00:23:55,030 --> 00:24:02,130
through onMaskedWalletLoaded
method that will get invoked.

536
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,780
It gets passed a
ConnectionResult and a

537
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,940
MaskedWallet.

538
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,390
So you check if it was
a success or not.

539
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:11,930
If it was a success, then
you got data back

540
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,540
from Instant Buy.

541
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,450
And now, you're ready to
update your UI with the

542
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,810
MaskedWallet data.

543
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:21,340
If it wasn't a success, it was
a failure, then it needs

544
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,000
resolution.

545
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,630
That means you need to show
the Instant Buy UI.

546
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,130
Typically, you'll probably
want to put that behind a

547
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:30,740
button, probably that Buy
With Google button.

548
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,360
So that's what we did
in this case.

549
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,700
We created a button.

550
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,580
And when it gets clicked,
then we call the

551
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:40,020
startResolutionForResult method
on ConnectionResult.

552
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,370
As I mentioned,
ConnectionResult.

553
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:45,880
is actually used throughout
our Play Services.

554
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,090
And when there is resolution,
it's basically wrapping a

555
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:49,820
pending intent behind it.

556
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,800
So it's turning around and
calling startActivityForResult

557
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,420
using that pending attempt.

558
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,980
So just like anything else,
when you use that

559
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:03,220
startActivityForResult paradigm,
your activity's

560
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,880
onActivityResult method will be
called once the Instant Buy

561
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,130
UI has been dismissed.

562
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:11,360

563
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,860
So if everything went smoothly,

564
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,150
you'll get a RESULT_OK.

565
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:18,820
This is the standard result
you'd see in Android

566
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,330
development.

567
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:23,640
In that case, you can pull the
MaskedWallet data out of the

568
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,400
intent passed to you
on ActivityResult.

569
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,960
And then you're ready
to update your UI.

570
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,620

571
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,910
If there was a problem, like
say, there was a network

572
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:37,220
connection issue, then you can
pull the errorCode out.

573
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:41,080
We have a list of error codes
in our documentation so that

574
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,310
you know what each of this
error codes mean.

575
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:46,015
And you can decide how to deal
with it in your application.

576
00:25:46,015 --> 00:25:49,420

577
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,830
So now, you've got the Masked
Wallet data, you're

578
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,940
ready to use it.

579
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:55,560
You're ready to update
your UI.

580
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,830
So you want to calculate the
sales tax and shipping, update

581
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,990
the totals for the transaction,
so the user sees

582
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,850
how much they are
going to pay.

583
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:06,630
You want to show the Masked
Wallet information, so the

584
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,930
description of the payment
instrument that's going to get

585
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:12,000
charged for this transaction
and the address things are

586
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,380
going to get shipped to.

587
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,740
And you should give your users
a chance to change this in

588
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,750
case they made a mistake.

589
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,370
Finally, you'll provide
a Confirmation button.

590
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:24,040
So once the user is happy with
their choices, they can

591
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,800
confirm the order.

592
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,600
When they confirm the order,
that's when you're ready to

593
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,520
get a Full Wallet.

594
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,250
So to get a Full Wallet, it's
very similar to getting a

595
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,450
Masked Wallet.

596
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:37,960
First, you build a
FullWalletRequest.

597
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,010
One thing I want to note here
is setting the Google

598
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,450
Transaction ID.

599
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,850
That's an ID that you're going
to get in the Masked Wallet

600
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,230
that gets returned to you.

601
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,280
And it lets us tie together this
FullWalletRequest to the

602
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,540
Masked Wallet we sent
earlier, so we know

603
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,780
which card to charge.

604
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,350
You can set some other option,
like the total price, line

605
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,510
items in the cart.

606
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,930
And then you could build
your request.

607
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:04,800
And then you pass that to
loadFullWallet , another API

608
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,370
on WalletClient.

609
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:08,460
And just like with
loadMaskedWallet, you'll pass

610
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,620
a listener to that as well.

611
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,060
That listener will have a single
method through the

612
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:17,010
implement onFullWalletLoaded.

613
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,200
And it follows a very similar
pattern that we saw,

614
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,880
onMaskedWalletLoaded.

615
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,720
You get a ConnectionResult
passed to you in

616
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,880
a fullWallet object.

617
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,260
You check if the result was a
success, in which case the

618
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,810
fullWallet object passed
you will not be Null.

619
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:35,200
And you can use it to send
to your back-end.

620
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,530
There is a chance that it
could require resolution

621
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,200
without a success.

622
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,090
This would happen if for some
reason we thought there was

623
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:43,690
something fraudulent about the
transaction, and we wanted to

624
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:47,360
challenge the user to confirm
their identity.

625
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,130
So in that case, you do a
startResolutionForResult, just

626
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:52,820
like you did with the Masked
Wallet request.

627
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:56,090

628
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:59,940
At this point, you're now
accepting Google Wallet.

629
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,470
So we'll just go over the
steps again real quick.

630
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:07,770
The first thing you want to do
is you get a Masked Wallet.

631
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,610
That is a description of the
payment instrument that's

632
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:12,920
going to be charged for the
user, so something like

633
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:17,516
MasterCard 1234, plus their
shipping address.

634
00:28:17,516 --> 00:28:20,880
If you're ready to show the
Instant Buy UI, the first time

635
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,190
a user uses Instant Buy in your
application, they'll need

636
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:28,230
to show you the Instant Buy UI,
so they can pick what card

637
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,560
they want to use, pick
which address.

638
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,000
They can change these things.

639
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,250
And that's where they get the
option to use Google Wallet as

640
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:37,890
their default payment method
for future transactions.

641
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,620
Finally, once the user is happy
with things, and they've

642
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,870
confirmed they want to pursue
the transaction, that's when

643
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,120
you get a Full Wallet.

644
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,880

645
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,210
Before moving on and talking
about single sign-on and

646
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:53,010
security, I want to mention
there's a few more Instant Buy

647
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,300
sessions at I/O this week.

648
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,010
Later today, there's session
called Building Compelling

649
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:00,810
mCommerce Experiences
on Android.

650
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:03,080
That's being given by two of the
engineers on the Instant

651
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,510
Buy team, plus an engineer
from the FANCY.

652
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:09,260
So I really I recommend
you attend that.

653
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,670
They've got a lot of great
tips, even some tips that

654
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:15,530
aren't necessarily particular to
mCommerce, but for Android

655
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,540
applications in general.

656
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:21,260
Finally, to really get into the
details of Instant Buy, we

657
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,310
have a Code Lab on Friday.

658
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,640
In the Code Lab, you get a
chance to integrate Instant

659
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,180
Buy into an existing
application.

660
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,680

661
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,560
Myself and several other Instant
Buy engineers will be

662
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,020
TAs for the Code Lab.

663
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,280
So I hope to see you them.

664
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:39,820

665
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:43,280
We talked about the faster
checkout part and how that

666
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,550
gets implemented.

667
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:48,030
We want to go back to single
sign-on, eliminating

668
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,770
registration and login
for users.

669
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:53,190

670
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:56,462
On here, you see a couple of
screen shot from the FANCY.

671
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:58,160
It's an app you might
have seen from the

672
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,770
keynote this morning.

673
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:03,590
On the screen on the left, you
see the FANCY with a couple of

674
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:05,580
sign-in options here.

675
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,740
The top one is a sign-in
with Google.

676
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,060
There's a couple of other
buttons on there I'm not as

677
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,350
familiar with.

678
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,540
I'm sure your users will hit
that big, beautiful red button

679
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,810
at the top, though.

680
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:18,200
And then they'll get the
screen on the right.

681
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,510
They're already signed in
through their Android device,

682
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,810
so they don't have to enter in
a name and password to sign

683
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:24,050
with Google.

684
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:27,210
Instead, they just have to
authorize your application to

685
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:28,460
use Google.

686
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,980

687
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,850
But wait, there's more.

688
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:36,040
Once you have a sign-in with
Google+, there's some extra

689
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,670
benefits you get from this.

690
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:41,810
And one of those is
social sharing.

691
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:46,570
So on these screens, on the far
left, I am posting through

692
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:49,990
my G+ account about a
shaved ice machine I

693
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,740
bought on the FANCY.

694
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:55,040
I really love shaved ice.

695
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,740
And who doesn't?

696
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,300
That's what I wrote
in the post.

697
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,230
The middle screen is how the
post will appear to my friends

698
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,420
when they see it on G+.

699
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,980
So they can see my
comment about it.

700
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,140
They can see a description
and a picture.

701
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,710
But most importantly, they
see a Buy button

702
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:13,000
right there on G+.

703
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,700
If they press that Buy button
and they already have the

704
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:19,030
FANCY on their device, they'll
be taken directly to the

705
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:22,710
shaved ice machine listing
in the FANCY.

706
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:26,200
And there they have a Buy Now
option with Google Wallet.

707
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,160
And they'll go into
the Chooser.

708
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,620
And they'll be able to complete
the transaction very

709
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,400
quickly as we see.

710
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,790
If they don't have the FANCY
installed, they'll be taken to

711
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:36,410
the Play Store where they
get a chance to

712
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:37,660
download the FANCY.

713
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,390

714
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:43,195
So with social sharing, you can
really drive downloads of

715
00:31:43,195 --> 00:31:44,265
the application and
engagement.

716
00:31:44,265 --> 00:31:46,780
And with Instant Buy, turn all
that into convergence.

717
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,800

718
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,330
Tomorrow, there's a Google+ Sign
In for Android Developers

719
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:56,250
session that goes into a lot
more detail on how Google+

720
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,500
Sign In works.

721
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,680

722
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:06,070
I know earlier Prakash mentioned
security and how

723
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,910
Instant Buy makes things
more secure.

724
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,840
And I'm sure all the developers
in the room were

725
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,630
shaking their heads going,
I don't trust the product

726
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:15,490
manager talking about
security.

727
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:17,480
But he was telling the truth.

728
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,520
Let me explain.

729
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,290
So Instant Buy is easier
and more secure.

730
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:25,150
And we've seen the easier
parts already.

731
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,650
How is it more secure?

732
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:29,960
Well, we don't actually share
the full credit card

733
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,800
information with anybody.

734
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,860
Consumers are always hearing
about some big corporations

735
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:38,640
leaking user data, including
credit cards.

736
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,610
And so you can't blame them if
they have a lot of anxiety

737
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:44,370
about sharing their credit card
information with some app

738
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:46,380
they just downloaded.

739
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,460
So we can eliminate
that anxiety.

740
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,380
They don't have to share
that full information.

741
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,260
They've already got their
information with Google.

742
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,700
So they can just
leverage that.

743
00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:00,280
Further, the credit cards that
we generate have a limit on

744
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,120
them that is closely tied to
the amount specified in the

745
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,620
FullWalletRequest.

746
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,520
So once they've been used for
a transaction, there's not

747
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,190
much money left on the cards.

748
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:10,820
So even if they were compromised
in some way,

749
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:13,390
there's not much damage
that can be done.

750
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,240
Further, they have an expiration
date that is

751
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,100
closely tied to when the
card was issued.

752
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,670
So there's really only a small
window where any problems

753
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,030
could happen.

754
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,980
Now you, guys, might be
wondering, is that going to

755
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:26,850
cause some complications
for us, these

756
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:29,040
generated virtual cards?

757
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,150
But the answer is no.

758
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:33,390
The card we give you is a
MasterCard just like any other

759
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,670
MasterCard.

760
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:37,890
So you can charge it just like
you would have if a user had

761
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,140
entered it by hand.

762
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,360

763
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,770
Every transaction made with
Instant Buy is also backed by

764
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:49,150
the Google risk engine because
data we get is not the only

765
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:52,070
thing users have
to worry about.

766
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,750
Crunching big numbers is
something that Google

767
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,410
is very good at.

768
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:56,260
And we use that capability.

769
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:59,070
We analyze each transaction and
challenge if we need to.

770
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:03,770
We're so confident in our
ability to detect fraud, we

771
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:06,020
offer the Google Wallet
Purchase Protection.

772
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:09,500
So any purchases made using
Instant Buy are guaranteed for

773
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,690
180 days after the purchase.

774
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:14,840
So again, this removed even
more anxiety for users and

775
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,115
helped them feel better about
making purchases.

776
00:34:17,115 --> 00:34:21,570

777
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:23,359
I'm going to wrap up
now and turn things

778
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:24,230
back over to Prakash.

779
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,880
He can tell you how you can
get access to Instant Buy.

780
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,040
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: Thank
you, Michael.

781
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,550
So I just wanted to recap what
we talked about earlier today.

782
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,610
We talked about fast
and easy checkout.

783
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:36,650
One thing I should mention is
we commissioned Mercator

784
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:39,110
Advisory Group, which is an
independent payments and

785
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,469
consulting firm.

786
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:44,080
And they said, when compared to
other digital wallets and

787
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,380
when compared to credit cards,
Google Wallet Instant Buy was

788
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,360
the fastest and easiest
way to checkout on

789
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,980
native Android apps.

790
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:54,050
So we talked about skipping
registration and

791
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,909
sign-in with G+.

792
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:58,980
Michael talked about security,
kept me honest.

793
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,500
And then we talked about
lightweight integration and

794
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,160
the fact that we don't charge
any additional fees.

795
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,740
So I think many of you are
thinking now, I'm interested

796
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,010
in this product.

797
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:09,900
How do I sign up?

798
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,880
What's next?

799
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,170
Well, this product is in
limited availability.

800
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:17,090
If you are interested, what we
would encourage you to do is

801
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,710
complete the Interest form.

802
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,880
The link is here.

803
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,400
We'd also be in the Office Hours
section right after this

804
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,490
to address any questions
you have.

805
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,120
If you fill out the Interest
form, we'll get back to you

806
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,380
very promptly.

807
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:31,910
And finally, I want to emphasize
that only sign up if

808
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:35,740
you're selling physical goods
and services on Android.

809
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:40,470
So we'll turn it over to Q&A.
But one more thing.

810
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,840
You've been a great audience.

811
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,810
And when I see around, I see
many familiar faces.

812
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,330
Many of you have been dedicated
partners integrated

813
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:50,960
with Google Wallet
Instant Buy.

814
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,350
So we really feel we
should reward you.

815
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,880
So with that, I'm going to
turn it over to Peter

816
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,575
Hazlehurst, who is director
of product management.

817
00:35:56,575 --> 00:35:59,440

818
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,370
PETER HAZLEHURST: Hi.

819
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:01,360
Thanks a lot, Prakash.

820
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,400
Awesome demos, guys.

821
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,950
Fantastic.

822
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:07,180
As some of you may have caught
the fact that we stealthily

823
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:11,590
announced a new product
at about noon today.

824
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:13,920
And that product is
the ability to

825
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,930
send money in Gmail.

826
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:19,250
And one of the really awesome
things about it is all you do

827
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,270
is, as long as you have a
wallet, you just click the

828
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:24,360
Attach Money button, attach
money like you would attach a

829
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,800
photo, and off the email
goes to the recipient.

830
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,310
If the recipient doesn't have
a wallet, we automatically

831
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,420
help them through the
sign-up process.

832
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,660
They get a wallet, they
receive their funds.

833
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,030
Everything's done and dusted.

834
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,350
It's really, really simple.

835
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:41,230
And it's just what you'd expect
from us in terms of our

836
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:44,000
integration with Gmail,
simplicity of the wallet, and

837
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,150
a great user story.

838
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:49,020
So we thought really hard about
how do we grow this

839
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,750
system and get people
using it.

840
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,840
And instead of the traditional
blast it out and everybody

841
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,180
gets it, we're doing something
a little special.

842
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,230
We're going to make this
a viral launch.

843
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:01,870
And the way the virality works
is if you have money, you can

844
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:03,110
send money.

845
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:07,600
And that seems rather stingy if
you guys don't have money.

846
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:12,700
So I went to my bank account and
figured out a way to send

847
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,240
all of you $10.

848
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,650
So in, plus or minus, a few
minutes from now, you should

849
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:21,030
receive an email from me saying,
"Welcome to send money

850
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,590
with Gmail.

851
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,930
And $10 is in your Google
Wallet." If you don't have

852
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:26,280
one, go get one.

853
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,550
And then if you're watching on
the Livestream and you want

854
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:32,430
access to send money in Gmail,
please find one of your

855
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:36,570
friends here at Google I/O
because that's the only way

856
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:37,300
you get it.

857
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,360
So please help us grow
the business.

858
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,830
And look forward to sharing
and sending

859
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:43,630
money across the net.

860
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,866
Thank you very much.

861
00:37:44,866 --> 00:37:51,820
[APPLAUSE]

862
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,310
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI:
Thank you, Peter.

863
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:55,450
So we'd like to open the floor
for question and answers.

864
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:58,320
And just a housekeeping note,
I know it's less than two

865
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,830
minutes to go, but we
don't want to cut

866
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:01,010
this discussion short.

867
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:03,700
So like I said earlier, right
after this presentation,

868
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,740
Michael and I will be
at the Office Hours

869
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,090
section in the Sandbox.

870
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:08,990
But why don't we take a few
questions in the remaining

871
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:11,320
time we have?

872
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,070
Go ahead, please.

873
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:16,650
Actually, yes, please go to the
microphone because this is

874
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:17,730
being live streamed.

875
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:20,590
So we want everybody on the
Livestream to be able to

876
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,422
listen to the question.

877
00:38:22,422 --> 00:38:25,522
AUDIENCE: So I'll go because
I'm at the mic.

878
00:38:25,522 --> 00:38:28,130
Jeff from Opera.

879
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:29,840
Congratulations on how far this
is coming and how much

880
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,310
easier it is for publishers and

881
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,530
e-commerce players to integrate.

882
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:37,210
Earlier in the keynote, you
talked about an HTML5 spec for

883
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:40,140
auto-complete on wallet, in
Chrome, and all that.

884
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,390
How do the two products
fit together?

885
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,640
Could you just repeat that?

886
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:47,100

887
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:50,050
MICHAEL GALPIN: So the product
shown in the keynote, Auto

888
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:56,370
Checkout, is for web pages, a
way to fill out these long

889
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:58,090
payment forms on web pages.

890
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:00,260
This is for native Android
applications.

891
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:03,020

892
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,370
AUDIENCE: Quick question.

893
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:07,280
You said you only have
it available for

894
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,470
products and services.

895
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:12,220
When will it be available for,
like golden sites, like

896
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:16,210
documents or videos or images
that you want to sell online?

897
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,720
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: Yes, if I
heard the question correctly,

898
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,560
if you're selling these little
golden services, we have a

899
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,360
great product already, Android
In-app Billing.

900
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,940
So I'd encourage you to use
Android In-app Billing if you

901
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,170
are selling a product which
involve these little goods

902
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:30,660
that are consumed on
or off the device.

903
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,860
AUDIENCE: Quick question here.

904
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:35,790
Is any geographic limitations
as far as support or added

905
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,310
currencies and countries yet?

906
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:37,710
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI:
Great question.

907
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:40,060
Actually, this product which I
mentioned before is we are

908
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,100
focused on the US right now.

909
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,000
So we do plan to expand
in the future.

910
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,110
But for now, the main
focus is the US.

911
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:49,285
So you need to be a US seller
and a US merchant.

912
00:39:49,285 --> 00:39:49,680
AUDIENCE: I see.

913
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,560
The second question is around
the funding source.

914
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,010
You referred to using a credit
card to back a credit card

915
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:55,550
transaction.

916
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:59,000
How about other funding source,
like a debit account

917
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,040
or a PayPal account or something
along those lines?

918
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,250
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: Sure.

919
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:05,330
So today we support credit
cards from all the major

920
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:07,480
network brands as a
funding source.

921
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,470
We don't support links to
a bank account today.

922
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,480
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

923
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,320
AUDIENCE: Yes, hi.

924
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,290
I have a few questions,
actually.

925
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:16,560
The first one, charge-backs.

926
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,510
How you handle them?

927
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:20,170
Like do I, as a developer,
get charge-backs?

928
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:21,250
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: That's
a great question.

929
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,810
And I'm glad you asked that
because this goes back to what

930
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:27,800
we said that we have minimum
impacts [INAUDIBLE].

931
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,000
You, as a developer or merchant,
would handle that

932
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,340
charge-back exactly the way
you handle a MasterCard

933
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,680
charge-back today.

934
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,400
It's as if I entered
my MasterCard

935
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,810
number on your site.

936
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:39,650
And if it was disputed, you
follow the exact same process.

937
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,460
No changes.

938
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,990
AUDIENCE: And how about
if I wanted to use in

939
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,750
my app other forms?

940
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:49,950
So if I want to choose Paypal
and Google Wallet, am I

941
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:51,370
allowed to do that?

942
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:54,370
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: So we have
our UI branding guidelines.

943
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:57,980
We know, again, it's consumer
choice and merchant choice.

944
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:01,170
But, yeah, you can use other
payment methods.

945
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:04,440
But we'd encourage you to look
at Google Wallet Instant Buy

946
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,480
and the SDK, and then make
an informed decision.

947
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,030
AUDIENCE: Perfect.

948
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,920
Thanks.

949
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,480
MICHAEL GALPIN: We'll
take any more

950
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,080
questions out at the Sandbox.

951
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:13,680
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: Thank you.

952
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,930
[APPLAUSE]

953
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,130
