00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,560

2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,530
VIC FRYZEL: Welcome to Google
I/O, and thank you for coming

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:06,520
to this talk.

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,200
Today, what I'm going to be
doing is introducing a new way

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,890
to administer your business on
Google, specifically with

6
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,840
Google Apps.

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,920
So just a quick poll.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,570
How many people in the room are
familiar with Google Apps

9
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,900
and the Admin APIs?

10
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:20,940
Everyone.

11
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,030
OK, you're in the right room.

12
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:28,180
So the Admin APIs are a set of
APIs that allow you to manage

13
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,150
your Google Apps for Business
domain or other additions, and

14
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,900
do things like create users
and manage your domain's

15
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:38,110
resources while also making
it easier to perform some

16
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,170
automated tasks.

17
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,650
So this is a collection
of more than 15 APIs.

18
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,970
It includes things today like
the Provisioning API, or the

19
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:51,930
Group Settings API, or the
Reports API, et cetera.

20
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,030
So the problem with this is that
thousands of applications

21
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,520
use these APIs every
single day.

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,830
There's a large number of these
APIs, but the developer

23
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,810
experience of the APIs
can be a little bit

24
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,160
difficult to navigate.

25
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,580
So if you break this down,
actually, this translates into

26
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,040
more than 125 million
requests per day.

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,710
That's more than a lot of small
companies get for their

28
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,810
entire app.

29
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,620
So here, these requests coming
in are doing things to manage

30
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,130
Google Apps for Business
domains.

31
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:25,450
What we're going to talk
about today is

32
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,830
making things even easier.

33
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,410
And if there's one thing that
you leave the room with today,

34
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,850
it should be with an
understanding that you should

35
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,200
go home, sleep, after Google
I/O, and then come into work

36
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,800
the next day and adopt what
we're about to launch, because

37
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,690
we're going to make your lives
significantly easier.

38
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,190
So this is directly
for IT admins.

39
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:48,620
Or if you're an ISV who's
developing software for users

40
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,010
of Google Apps for Business, if
you're a reseller of Google

41
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,200
Apps for Business, all
of this stuff is

42
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,960
going to apply to you.

43
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,040
So we've, over the years, taken
a lot of requests from

44
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,060
developers.

45
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,840
So the Google Apps Admin APIs
are actually one of our oldest

46
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,370
sets of APIs.

47
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,280
I've worked at Google for almost
four years, and I've

48
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,520
worked on them since my first
day at Google, and then even

49
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,720
before that, they existed.

50
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,960
So we've gotten a lot of
requests from developers over

51
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,350
the years, and today,
we're going to

52
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,260
address some of those.

53
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,960
One of the top requests was the
ability to search and sort

54
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,890
your result sets just much more
easily from things in

55
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:22,620
your domain.

56
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,170
Another one is batch requests.

57
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,240
I need to, for instance, create
a bunch of users at

58
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,350
once or get a whole bunch of
information about a collection

59
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,680
of users at the same time.

60
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,500
Enterprise attributes.

61
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,870
And then more customizable
reporting.

62
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,740
And then finally, I think the
biggest request has been for

63
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,070
functional parity with the admin
panel for Google Apps

64
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,820
for Business.

65
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,670
So here, we have my
friend Namrata.

66
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,850
This is all of her information
in my test domain.

67
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,510
And you can see there's a whole
bunch of information

68
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,080
here that is pretty common.

69
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,500
This represents Namrata in
a traditional business

70
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,210
environment.

71
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,780
So I have things here like her
phone number, her email

72
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,820
addresses, which groups she
belongs to, and also her

73
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,970
username and profile photo.

74
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,880
So today, there's a problem and
the problem is that to get

75
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,060
her profile photo, I have to
make a call out to the

76
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,730
Profiles API.

77
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:17,080
And then to get her username and
other user information, I

78
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,680
have to make a call out to
the Provisioning API.

79
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,330
Yet another API call, at least,
to get things like her

80
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:29,640
nickname or her aliases, and
then yet a fourth request to

81
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,050
get the groups to which
she belongs.

82
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,400
So this is a little
bit too much.

83
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,510
And just a quick show of hands,
how many people in the

84
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,750
room have run into
things like this?

85
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,180
Almost everybody raises
their hands.

86
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,630
OK, so I have good
news for you.

87
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,080
Today, we're launching
the Admin SDK.

88
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,230
And the Admin SDK is a brand
new developer experience

89
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,300
around managing things
in your Google Apps

90
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,720
for Business domain.

91
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,490
What we're going to do is talk
about how we're going to

92
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,170
simplify the developer
experience, and I'm going to

93
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,050
introduce a few new
APIs to you.

94
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:05,030
And I think what you're going to
love about this is how easy

95
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:09,390
it is to integrate, and also
how easy it is to do more

96
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,250
advanced things in
your domain.

97
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,000
So we're launching
two APIs today.

98
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,070
The first one is the Directory
API, and the next one is the

99
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,079
Reports API.

100
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,850
I'm going to go through
each one.

101
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:25,220
The goal of the two APIs is to
be as simple as possible,

102
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,370
giving you all of the data you
need and all of the actions

103
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,520
you need while getting
out of your way.

104
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,530
Consistent, so what we want to
do here is make sure that all

105
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:37,080
of our API surface areas look
identical so that you don't

106
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,950
have to do special tweaks or
integrations between multiple

107
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,990
APIs in order to get
things working.

108
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,420
And then lastly,
comprehensive.

109
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,370
We want to expose as much of
the functionality in the

110
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,830
Google Apps Admin Panel
as possible.

111
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,640
So when you come away today,
know that these are our goals,

112
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,400
overall, for the platform.

113
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,260
So the Directory API allows
you to manage

114
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,580
objects in your domain.

115
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,340
So this includes the traditional
objects like

116
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,150
users, groups, and org units.

117
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,680
However today, the Directory
API will also allow you to

118
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,850
manage devices in your domain.

119
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,700
So to give you some sense of
what's going on here, here I

120
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,710
have a bunch of common endpoints
that you would use

121
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,350
today for things like the
Provisioning API or the

122
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,990
Profiles API.

123
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,320
And what we're going to do is
boil all of these things down

124
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,880
into a single API called
the Directory API.

125
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,780
And here you can see all of
those endpoints, they

126
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,450
roll up into one.

127
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:31,050
So this is going towards the
simplicity goal that we have

128
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,920
for the Admin SDK.

129
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,440
The next one is the
Reports API.

130
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,780
So the Reports API is going to
allow you to create just

131
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,850
richer reports on things going
on within your domain.

132
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,230
Here, you can see this graph was
able to be generated with

133
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,220
all of the data coming back,
and this is just usage

134
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,440
activity of each service
within your domain.

135
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,880
Another way to generate a report
is just all of the

136
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,820
different activities going on
within your domain so that you

137
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,960
can, much more easily,
do things

138
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,940
like audits, for instance.

139
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,410
So let's take a demo.

140
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:07,885
So Ankur in the audience
wrote this demo app.

141
00:06:07,885 --> 00:06:09,780
It's called Device Explorer,
and this is

142
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,360
doing something new.

143
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,220
So a few important points about
this application are

144
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,330
that it's hosted on App Engine,
so it's a third-party

145
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:19,930
application, and it's using
everything that I just talked

146
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,290
about to allow you to manage
devices within a Google Apps

147
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,510
for Business domain.

148
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,140
Ankur did a few special
things.

149
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:31,580
One, he allowed his admin to log
in with Google+ Sign In,

150
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,000
which is a new mechanism for
signing users into your

151
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,960
applications, and you can use
that with Google Apps for

152
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,360
Business domains.

153
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,970
So that's definitely something
that you should consider

154
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,630
changing your application
to use.

155
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,670
It's just a lot easier
to implement.

156
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,390
And also, it allows you to get
all of the same access that

157
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:48,190
you have with your application
today.

158
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:52,280
The next thing is he used the
Directory API to create a

159
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,610
Device Explorer here.

160
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,600
And this Device Explorer allows
you to manage devices

161
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,480
within your domain.

162
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:03,910
So here, for example, if I click
on this device, this is

163
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,950
all of the information about
the owner of this device.

164
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:10,230
And if I go back, if I click on
the device itself, you can

165
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,680
see all of the information
about the device.

166
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,865
So this is important because on
occasion, what will happen

167
00:07:14,865 --> 00:07:19,000
is one of your users may
register a non-approved device

168
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,880
on your domain or somebody
would lose their device--

169
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,180
maybe leave it on a train or
something to that effect.

170
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,530
And what you as the admin have
to do is be able to disable

171
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,470
this device quickly
and easily.

172
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:34,550
Now, it really gets a lot easier
to do mass changes with

173
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,660
tools like this.

174
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,670
So obviously, in your own
business or in your own

175
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,440
software, you may need to do
some advanced things like

176
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,440
provision 1,000 devices, and
that's not something you want

177
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,830
somebody clicking around
and doing manually.

178
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,870
So that's where the Directory
API really shines.

179
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:54,210
It allows your application to
do more advanced concepts.

180
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:58,620
So here, just to take a simple
example, what I can do is

181
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,040
select this device from Ken, and
I can do various things.

182
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,560
Its current status is Approved,
but I can also block

183
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,180
it or delete it.

184
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,740
So if I block it and take this
action, it says Done.

185
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:14,800
And if I reload the page, you
can see, after the Wi-Fi

186
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,530
cooperates, that the device from
Ken is now blocked, and

187
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,620
this has also been applied in
the Google Apps Admin Panel.

188
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,750
So this is one of
the new features

189
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,330
we're launching today.

190
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:26,440
And this demo application is one
way to kind of see what's

191
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,730
going on there.

192
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:38,380
So if I come back to the
presentation, the next thing

193
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,880
we're going to do is walk
through the code that made

194
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,039
that application possible.

195
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:45,430
So just to give you an idea of
how the code is structured,

196
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:49,390
it's a very common model
view controller set up.

197
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,650
Here, the servlets act as
controllers, and the view is

198
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:53,600
index.html.

199
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,580
That's really just a template.

200
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,140
And then we have our servlets
talk to the client library.

201
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,420
Our data model here is
completely represented by the

202
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,440
Directory API.

203
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,500
So that's important to note.

204
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,410
We don't really have
a local data model.

205
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,940
So the first thing we're going
to do is query mobile devices

206
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,330
in the domain.

207
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:13,430
So here, you can see a method
on the devices servlet to do

208
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,480
that, and you can see actually
how simple it is.

209
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,300
So here, just with four lines
of code, I'm able to get a

210
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,370
list of devices within the
domain and then print them to

211
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,470
the screen.

212
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,140
This is one of the ways that
we're really trying to address

213
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,750
that simplicity factor again.

214
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,150
Just making it easier for you to
get the data that you need

215
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,400
out of your Google
Apps domain.

216
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,120

217
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:41,280
The next thing we can do is
query for individual devices,

218
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,240
and then just return the list.

219
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,790
So the previous method just
printed a list, and here, we

220
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:49,270
actually get the list of
devices themselves.

221
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,710
And then we can also get
matching devices with a query.

222
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,530
So I don't know if you noticed
this in the sample

223
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,600
application, but there was
a search mechanism.

224
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,340
And I can apply that search
mechanism here.

225
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,150
In case I have thousands of
devices in my domain, I don't

226
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,490
have to find each
one by scrolling

227
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,600
through hundreds of pages.

228
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,260
That add row to device table
method is really just a view

229
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,400
generator method that creates a
table row with the device's

230
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,610
information.

231
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:16,870
And then taking action
on a device.

232
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,730
For instance, I blocked
a device.

233
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,730
You can see how that's
done here via

234
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,510
this take action method.

235
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:26,420
So the take action method is
really just a wrapper around

236
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,940
these five lines of code.

237
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,010
So these five lines of code
create a new directory object,

238
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:35,890
which allows you to interact
with the Directory API.

239
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:38,360
And then a mobile device action,
I which create a new

240
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,260
action object that
I want to set.

241
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,970
In this case, it
might be block.

242
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:46,390
And that action parameter is
just a string representing the

243
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,930
action's name.

244
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:51,180
And then I set up the request,
and I call Execute.

245
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,280
And once I call Execute, this
makes a request out to the API

246
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,180
and blocks the device.

247
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,540
So one thing that we've noticed
is that an easy way

248
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,220
for us to guarantee that there
is feature parity between the

249
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:10,500
Google Apps user interface and
the Admin SDK is to use our

250
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,380
own Admin SDK to build the
Google Apps interface.

251
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,710
So what does that mean?

252
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:20,710
Well, I'm going to switch over
here to my demo tablet.

253
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,990
And this is something
launching towards

254
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:23,740
the end of the month.

255
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,380
It's a mobile C panel.

256
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,970
So this mobile C panel allows
me to manage my users and

257
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:32,600
groups and other domain
resources while on the go.

258
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,060
So this works on my phone or
on my tablet, and this is

259
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,740
something that Google
is going to release.

260
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,965
The important thing to note
about this entire application

261
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:42,030
is it's built using our
Admin SDK, so we're

262
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,450
eating our own dog food.

263
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:45,670
We know that the Admin SDK works
and works well, because

264
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,490
we have to use it as well.

265
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,700
So here if I click Users,
you can see all of

266
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,280
the users in my domain.

267
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,600
And if I click Ankur, I can
find out more information

268
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,930
about Ankur.

269
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:00,930
So here, I can do other things,
like I can edit

270
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,100
Ankur's information.

271
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,700
So I could change his name,
I could change his email

272
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,710
address, or change
his phone number.

273
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,602
I could add a new
phone number.

274
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:13,160
I'll just punch in a random
phone number here, click Done,

275
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,210
and OK, and it updated
the user on the spot.

276
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,860
So what that just did was make
a call out to the Admin SDK

277
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,110
and save that new
phone number.

278
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:25,710
If I come back, click Done,
I can do other things.

279
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,220
I can also suspend the user
or delete the user.

280
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,240
And then if I come back to this
menu, I can also do other

281
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,180
things like manage groups.

282
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,620
So if I look at the All Managers
@ACME Group, here you

283
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:42,470
can see this admin@ankurt10sep
is one of the users, but I've

284
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,940
decided that I want to
make this user an

285
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,860
owner of this group.

286
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:49,970
So I edit the role, and I click
Owner, and I click Save.

287
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:54,170
And when I click Save, Ankur is
now an owner of this group.

288
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:59,500
So you can see there, using
this app that we've built,

289
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,530
we're actually using a lot of
the features that you would

290
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,700
have to use in order to build
your own applications with

291
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,950
maybe more advanced use cases.

292
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,650
So this is something that's
becoming super important to us

293
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,460
and it's a goal for us
in the long term.

294
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,700
And I really want to sell that
point because I realize that

295
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,540
previously, there has been
somewhat of a disconnect

296
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,730
between the Google Apps Admin
UI and what was available to

297
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:19,910
do via the API.

298
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,280
And this is something that
we're really keen on

299
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:21,810
addressing.

300
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,240
I know that a lot of you in the
audience need to do some

301
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,180
edge case that the UI allows
and the API doesn't.

302
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,350
And so what you have to tell
your users is, oh, by the way,

303
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,820
you can't do that in my tool.

304
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,440
You have to go to the
Apps Admin UI.

305
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,430
We are addressing that
point directly.

306
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,280
So in the coming months, you'll
start to see that get

307
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,560
better and better and better.

308
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,420
So what's next?

309
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:48,310
The next things that we have
going on are essentially

310
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,570
improving the developer
experience across the board.

311
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:58,760
So here, in the documentation--

312
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,080
forgive me.

313
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,720
Let me switch my screen.

314
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,350
Pretty noob mistake
right there.

315
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,480
So let me show you the
documentation here.

316
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,200
This is how it looks today, and
you can see that huge list

317
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,710
of APIs I mentioned
previously.

318
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,970
And it's also kind of difficult
to find out what you

319
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,710
need to do in order to address
your use case.

320
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,540
Today, we're launching this,
and it's our new developer

321
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,490
experience for the Admin SDK.

322
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,560
So here you can see, we've moved
to more documenting the

323
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,240
use cases and not so much
documenting individual APIs.

324
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,560
So if you need to manage users,
for instance, or if

325
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,340
you're new to the Admin SDK, you
probably don't really care

326
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,260
that that's the Directory API.

327
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,560
Rather, you just want to see
how to do it and then later

328
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,340
on, you'll start to learn our
own terminology as you become

329
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,710
more and more of an expert.

330
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:47,620
So we're working on making it
easier for new users of the

331
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,560
Admin SDK while also keep
keeping it as good reference

332
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,320
material for advanced users.

333
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,760
And we're also working on
keeping it very up-to-date

334
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,450
when we add new features
to the Admin SDK.

335
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:01,910
So in making integration easier,
again, we're working

336
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,970
on reproducing the simplicity
and consistency of the two

337
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:10,480
APIs, both Directory and
Reporting, into other APIs

338
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,530
that will be a part
of the Admin SDK.

339
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,330
And we're also looking at giving
more feature complete

340
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,980
sample applications in a broad
range of languages.

341
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:21,010
What's important to note is that
these two new APIs are on

342
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,930
our new API infrastructure
at Google.

343
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,740
You'll know that some of the
previous APIs have been on

344
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:30,300
this thing called G Data, and
G Data had custom client

345
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,350
libraries for every
single API.

346
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,080
Whereas with the new API
infrastructure, the client

347
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,690
libraries are consistently
kept up-to-date in a more

348
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,350
automated way so that, for
instance, the Java client

349
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,370
library, if you download the
latest version, you will

350
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:46,340
immediately have access to the
latest features of the API.

351
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,610
There's no delay there.

352
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:52,380
The other thing, again, that
we're really focusing on is

353
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,590
continued feature parity
with Google UX.

354
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:58,240
And we're starting to do this by
developing the applications

355
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,640
for Google using our
APIs first and then

356
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,050
adding features second.

357
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:08,570
So with that, the upcoming
features.

358
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,330
We're going to add more
enterprise objects in the API.

359
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,850
We know this is a huge feature
request, and we're working on

360
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:17,650
making the availability of
data just much wider.

361
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,510
We're also working on giving
powerful structured search.

362
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:23,800
The worst thing on the planet
that I'm sure everybody in the

363
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,740
room has encountered is having
to fetch a full list of

364
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,450
resources and then manually
search them

365
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,640
yourself, and that sucks.

366
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,750
So we're working on making that
just a lot better so that

367
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,260
you don't have to do a lot of
that processing on your end.

368
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,900
Also, we're giving an extensible
user schema--

369
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,850
and this is a big one-- so that
you can set more and more

370
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:45,980
properties on a per user basis
so that you don't have to have

371
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,390
a separate data store for some
properties about your users

372
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:52,840
and then use Google Apps for
the other properties.

373
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,520
We're going to give you a
login activity audit.

374
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,020
Again, I think this
has been a pretty

375
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,600
popular feature request--

376
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,870
the ability to just detect
logins from users.

377
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:06,440
And then lastly, we're going to
give G+ reports and let you

378
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,200
find out exactly how
your users are

379
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,790
interacting with Google+.

380
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,730
So with that, thank you.

381
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,410
And what I'd like to do
now is take questions.

382
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,450
There's two microphones.

383
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:22,790
[APPLAUSE]

384
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:22,810
AUDIENCE: Hey Vic.

385
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,740
It's Charlie Wood.

386
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,170
A couple of questions.

387
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,315
First of all, I know there was
talk about push notifications

388
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:30,760
in at least some
of these APIs.

389
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,190
Is that included?

390
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,810
Is it roadmap?

391
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,820
VIC FRYZEL: That's
in the roadmap.

392
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,050
AUDIENCE: Second, what is the
process, or is there a

393
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:44,230
process, for increasing
API quotas?

394
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,400
VIC FRYZEL: So that's a
very good question.

395
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,660
So these two new APIs are
managed in the Google APIs

396
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,190
Console, which I didn't show.

397
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,600
If you've used any other Google
API really, I'm sure

398
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,000
you're familiar with the
Google APIs Console.

399
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,700
When you go there, there is, as
of today, this new option

400
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,520
called Admin SDK.

401
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,720
And when you can flip Admin SDK
on and off, you can also

402
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,090
request more quota.

403
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,580
And what that does is it sends
an automated item into our

404
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,110
system and then we review
it each week.

405
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,750
And then that would allow
you to get more quota.

406
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,960
AUDIENCE: And then finally, this
is kind of a detail, but

407
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,230
when you're fetching a long
list and you're paging 100

408
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:23,870
results at a time, did it make
it in to where the total

409
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,840
number of requests and the total
result set is actually

410
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,980
in each page?

411
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,740
VIC FRYZEL: You mean the result
size, like the total

412
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,950
number of users in each page?

413
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:31,420
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

414
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,610
VIC FRYZEL: Yeah,
that made it in.

415
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,540
AUDIENCE: All right.

416
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,990
Thanks.

417
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,020
VIC FRYZEL: I'll take
one from the back.

418
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,050
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

419
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,520
My name's Scott Howell.

420
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,940
I'm curious about the Google
Sign In for external websites

421
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:48,020
and how this Admin SDK--

422
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:52,640
can you assign different levels
of rights to those

423
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,210
users for those external sites,
ie, say I have, I don't

424
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:03,680
know, 500 users in my Google
domain and I want to give them

425
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:08,510
access to an external website,
can I manage those user levels

426
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,660
through this?

427
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,350
VIC FRYZEL: So you mean access
to use Google+ Sign In on

428
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,480
another website?

429
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,990
AUDIENCE: On an external
website not part of--

430
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:17,710
VIC FRYZEL: I'm with you.

431
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,440
AUDIENCE: Not a Google App.

432
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,800
VIC FRYZEL: So currently, you
can't manage that per

433
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,790
application basis.

434
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:26,600
What you can do is
revoke access

435
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,640
after it's been granted.

436
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,820
And what we're working on is
making it so that you can

437
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,140
control individual access.

438
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:35,120
Let's hypothetically say that
you wanted to add an

439
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,140
application to all of your
users, and you want to give

440
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,820
them access to that application
specifically, but

441
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,750
not to all of the other
applications on the web,

442
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,020
that's something that
we're working on.

443
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,680
AUDIENCE: OK.

444
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:43,920
Great.

445
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,220
Thank you.

446
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:45,485
AUDIENCE: Hi.

447
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:47,620
I'm [INAUDIBLE] from Sears.

448
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,000
The question that I had is when
you are trying to add the

449
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,620
objects, do have the ability to
maintain the history of the

450
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,240
changes that have been done
on the user profiles?

451
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,670
Like for example, my phone
number was XYZ.

452
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,420
Phone number now is ABC.

453
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,220
Can I track the XYZ as well?

454
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,220
VIC FRYZEL: Yeah, so that's part
of this new SDK as well.

455
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:05,710
AUDIENCE: Sure.

456
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,160
Thanks.

457
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,920
VIC FRYZEL: Thank you.

458
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,250
AUDIENCE: Is this new API going
to be available, or is

459
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,620
it available already, for
Google Apps Script?

460
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,550
VIC FRYZEL: For Google
Apps Script?

461
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,130
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

462
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:20,440
VIC FRYZEL: So the existing apps
interface exists already

463
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,390
on Apps Script, and what we're
working on is updating it to

464
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,950
use the new SDK.

465
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:27,160
I don't have a timeline for you,
but it should be soon.

466
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:27,590
Hi.

467
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:27,760
AUDIENCE: Hi.

468
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,860
This is [INAUDIBLE]

469
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,320
from SAP.

470
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,250
We had an example of device
management with a device

471
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,060
approved and rejected.

472
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:40,290
What are the plans for Google
regarding remote device

473
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,210
management?

474
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,300
VIC FRYZEL: Remote device
management?

475
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:42,990
AUDIENCE: Yes.

476
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:47,770
For example, when the company
has a set of employees with

477
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:53,680
mobile devices, does Google
have plans to set up more

478
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:58,000
capabilities to manage maybe
remote device wipe or those

479
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,840
type of features?

480
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,950
VIC FRYZEL: So what we have
today is the ability to

481
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:06,990
install an application on your
device that lets you know the

482
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:11,120
state of the device remotely.

483
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,900
However, I don't have anything
to announce today about our

484
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,970
plans there in the
longer term.

485
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:17,080
Thanks.

486
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,262
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

487
00:21:19,262 --> 00:21:19,700
AUDIENCE: Hi.

488
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,730
My name's Raoul.

489
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:21,990
I have two questions.

490
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:27,110
One, any update on auto
sign out or time

491
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,540
out for Google Apps?

492
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,950
Or if a user is signed in and
he is not active for 30

493
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:37,160
minutes, is there something
which we can trigger that will

494
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,780
sign him out of the session?

495
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,490
That's one.

496
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:43,755
And second question is, though
there is an audit trail which

497
00:21:43,755 --> 00:21:48,470
you have started on Google
Docs, does it cover the

498
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,640
external files also
which we upload?

499
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,560
VIC FRYZEL: The external
files that you upload?

500
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,070
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

501
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,610
VIC FRYZEL: Both of your
questions I think I have a

502
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,750
solution to, but they're a
little bit more advanced.

503
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,050
Come find me afterward,
and I'd be

504
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:00,970
happy to walk you through.

505
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:01,390
AUDIENCE: Sure.

506
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,040
Thanks.

507
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,350
AUDIENCE: Hi.

508
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,760
I'm Jeff Williams from the
University of Minnesota.

509
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,490
At the University of Minnesota,
we have five

510
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:12,230
different domains that are each
with a different account

511
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:15,600
and they're not merged
together.

512
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,510
Is there any way that we could
leave the data in place but

513
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:21,940
have you update the metadata to
consolidate the domains so

514
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:26,210
that we have a single human
domain instead of having five

515
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,590
separate domains?

516
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:30,711
VIC FRYZEL: A single domain
instead of five separate.

517
00:22:30,711 --> 00:22:31,930
So you want to merge
the domains

518
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,550
without merging the domains?

519
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,460
AUDIENCE: We want to merge them,
but we don't want to

520
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,480
copy all of the data that's in
there back to our servers and

521
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,010
lose fidelity, and then copy it
back to your servers again.

522
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:44,410
Because why?

523
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,430
You've got all of the documents
for all of the

524
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:51,330
different campuses, so if we
could log in as admin on the

525
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,990
source and the destination
domain, we might be able to

526
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:57,440
migrate the users over by just
updating on your side the

527
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,310
metadata that describes the
access permissions that they

528
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,050
have to the various pieces.

529
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,300
VIC FRYZEL: That's a really
good feature request.

530
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,710
Come find me afterward, and
I'd like to take some

531
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,590
requirements about that, and
then I could make sure that

532
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,840
that lands.

533
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,820

534
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,830
AUDIENCE: Frank LoCascio,
Esource Capital,

535
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:16,180
a Google Apps reseller.

536
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:20,970
On the APIs, is there going to
be work done on the APIs that

537
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:23,900
go after the data in the
reseller console?

538
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,210
VIC FRYZEL: Are there
any APIs that what?

539
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:28,200
AUDIENCE: Go after the data
in the reseller console.

540
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,370
VIC FRYZEL: We do have a
set of APIs for this.

541
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,665
Come find me afterward,
and I can point you

542
00:23:31,665 --> 00:23:32,470
in the right direction.

543
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:35,350
AUDIENCE: OK, and a little bit
different than APIs, another

544
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,110
quick question.

545
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:39,580
Will there ever be the ability
to change the primary domain?

546
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,560
VIC FRYZEL: Change the
primary domain?

547
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,822
I don't think so.

548
00:23:45,822 --> 00:23:46,960
AUDIENCE: We have companies
changing

549
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,370
their names, and it's--

550
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,340
VIC FRYZEL: Yeah, freaking
companies, man.

551
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:54,498
[LAUGHTER]

552
00:23:54,498 --> 00:23:55,890
VIC FRYZEL: Hey.

553
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:56,300
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

554
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:56,630
I'm Chris.

555
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,750
I'm with June Star.

556
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:04,430
I support maybe 12, 15 companies
in Google Apps, and

557
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:08,010
depending on when they were
deployed, I have to juggle two

558
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:11,670
different admin consoles, resort
to GAM to get a lot of

559
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,340
stuff done that I can't
get done through

560
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,340
various ones of those.

561
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,760
And keeping track of who's on
where and who knows what is a

562
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,520
bit of a hassle.

563
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,010
Is this going to supplant all
of that juggling, or?

564
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,570
VIC FRYZEL: It's going to
definitely make a lot better.

565
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:26,680
Do you develop your
own applications?

566
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,530
AUDIENCE: As little as I
can, but I do have to

567
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:31,780
do some of it sometimes.

568
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,700

569
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,600
VIC FRYZEL: Two things
I would say.

570
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,060
One is that we're working on
making the admin panel just

571
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,530
more robust.

572
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:42,380
I'm sure there are certain edge
cases that you're having

573
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,170
trouble telling your users to
do, and that's where your

574
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,360
application comes into play.

575
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,870
I'm not sure specifically
in your case what

576
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,260
those edge cases are.

577
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:54,430
I'd be happy to discuss them
on a one by one basis.

578
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,230
But we're working on making
the admin panel just more

579
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:58,650
robust so that you can do
more of these things.

580
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:02,650
The other thing I would say is
that as we're working to hit

581
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:07,030
feature parity between the Admin
SDK and the Admin UI,

582
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:10,170
everything that you can do in
the UI, you'll be able to do

583
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:10,900
in the SDK.

584
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,740
So in those cases in which
you're sending a user just to

585
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,800
the admin panel to do one
thing and then to your

586
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,960
software to do something else,
they could eventually have one

587
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,660
destination.

588
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,620
It's either going to be
in the admin panel

589
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,230
itself or in your software.

590
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,360
So come find me afterward.

591
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,980
I'd be happy to talk about
your specific edge cases.

592
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,340
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

593
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,340
VIC FRYZEL: Thanks.

594
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,750
Hey.

595
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:32,030
AUDIENCE: Hi.

596
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,320
Miguel from the [INAUDIBLE]
company.

597
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,650
Does this Admin SDK
plan to have PKI

598
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,840
management at one point?

599
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,640
VIC FRYZEL: I didn't hear
the last part, sorry.

600
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,030
AUDIENCE: PKI.

601
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:44,170
VIC FRYZEL: Can you--

602
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:48,750
AUDIENCE: PKI, certificate
management.

603
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,520
VIC FRYZEL: Sorry.

604
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,640
I totally did not get
your abbreviation.

605
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,320
Public Key Management?

606
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,900
AUDIENCE: Yes.

607
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,030
VIC FRYZEL: I don't
think that we have

608
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:57,960
that in the near future.

609
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,610
I would say that that's a really
good feature request.

610
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:05,740
The entire product team for the
Admin SDK is in this room,

611
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,220
so they're hearing everything
that you say.

612
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,450
[LAUGHTER]

613
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:11,080
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

614
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,770
VIC FRYZEL: Hey.

615
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:15,570
AUDIENCE: So I wanted to plus
one Charlie's request for the

616
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,440
push notifications and the
change feed for the--

617
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:17,950
VIC FRYZEL: Absolutely.

618
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,400
That's definitely
in the pipeline.

619
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,720
AUDIENCE: And also, the
[? three LO ?], understanding

620
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,560
what's been authorized by
someone within the domain.

621
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,790
VIC FRYZEL: Understanding what's
been authorized by

622
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:30,100
somebody in the domain?

623
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,840
AUDIENCE: Someone approves
certain requests in the

624
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,610
marketplace, someone within your
domain, so just to know

625
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:38,130
what has been approved by which
users within the domain.

626
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:38,440
VIC FRYZEL: Got it.

627
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,150
That's something we
can help you with.

628
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:42,190
AUDIENCE: Today?

629
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,320
VIC FRYZEL: You can view that
data today, but you can't

630
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,120
programmatically access
it in the SDK today.

631
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,700
AUDIENCE: OK.

632
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,970
Lastly, Charlie was also talking
about the quotas.

633
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:54,430
So I understand the per day
quota, but for us, I think the

634
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,810
bigger bottleneck, especially
when you're trying to run in

635
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:59,670
parallel, is the per second
quota, the server limits.

636
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,520
So is that--

637
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,540
VIC FRYZEL: We can help
you out there.

638
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,950
Worst case, we just
multiply your per

639
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:09,830
second quota by 80,000.

640
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:12,210
But I think we can help
you out there.

641
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:16,190
I don't know if we have a
specific per second quota set.

642
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,530
I'm sure we do.

643
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,570
No?

644
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,010
No.

645
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:22,520
So come find me afterward and
we can talk about how to get

646
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,730
your-- like I understand
that case.

647
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:26,910
Like you migrate a university
and while migrating that

648
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:30,670
university, you're making
constant requests in one day.

649
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,470
And you're trying to finish your
migration in less than a

650
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,480
week or something, right?

651
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,760
That's what you're
talking about?

652
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,320
So I understand that in that
week, your QPS is going to be

653
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,170
through the roof.

654
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:41,150
And then next week, you
go on vacation.

655
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:42,420
You've been paid, right?

656
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:48,560
And so we can set a very, very
high queries per day limit,

657
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,990
and that would still suffice.

658
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:52,370
And since there's no queries per
second limit, I think you

659
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,990
would be OK.

660
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:57,680
The other thing you could do
to make that even faster is

661
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,550
just set up concurrent
requests.

662
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:02,000
So if you thread this stuff
out, you can actually send

663
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,540
your QPS up very, very high
and still get a high

664
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:08,870
throughput rate for migrating
accounts or whatever.

665
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:11,756
AUDIENCE: So there's
no per second rate?

666
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:13,006
VIC FRYZEL: No.

667
00:28:13,006 --> 00:28:16,220

668
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:16,460
Hold on.

669
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,240
I misspoke.

670
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,427
There is one, I just don't
know what it is off

671
00:28:19,427 --> 00:28:20,100
the top of my head.

672
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,350
[LAUGHTER]

673
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,232
VIC FRYZEL: Sorry, man.

674
00:28:25,232 --> 00:28:26,160
Hey.

675
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,610
AUDIENCE: Hey.

676
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,830
Jeff Williams from
the U of M again.

677
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:31,020
So you might not be the right
person, but I'm going to ask

678
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,275
anyway, just in case.

679
00:28:32,275 --> 00:28:37,620
When we rename a user with the
API, sometimes the user's

680
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,080
rename doesn't go through
very quickly.

681
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,810
They don't get an alias or
nickname, because we've got

682
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:47,290
many domains that are there.

683
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:51,330
So they can't get mail for
potentially a day.

684
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,610
Most of the time,
it's not a day.

685
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:54,370
Most of the time,
it's right away.

686
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,810
But then sometimes when it's
not, then apparently there's

687
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:59,420
some process that Google does
to catch up on the ones that

688
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,020
didn't make it successfully.

689
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,620
And then there's sometimes ones
that don't make it from

690
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,320
the first and the second
layer of that process.

691
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,540
And we've had tickets with
Google about it, and every

692
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:12,980
time, it's all happy and good
until we get to the third or

693
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:18,080
fourth level, and then it's
like, oh yeah, well, sorry.

694
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,970
VIC FRYZEL: So forgive me.

695
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:23,300
That is Google's problem,
and it's something

696
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,530
we're working on.

697
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:25,830
I'm sorry that you had
to endure that.

698
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,230
I realize that's a bad
experience, and it's something

699
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,980
that we really care about
and are fixing.

700
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,730
I'm familiar with that specific
issue, and it's

701
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,300
something that we've been
working on for a while.

702
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,600
It's a very complicated
problem on our end.

703
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,670

704
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:41,460
A lot of people don't quite
understand this, but

705
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,910
essentially when you create a
user at Google, that touches

706
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:46,530
more than 1,000 machines
instantly within

707
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:47,730
a matter of a minute.

708
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:50,860
And so keeping those machines
in sync can

709
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,550
sometimes be tricky.

710
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,860
So feel free to come find me
afterward or find any of the

711
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:58,040
team here, and I'd be happy to
help you address that as soon

712
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,030
as possible.

713
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,030
Thanks.

714
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:01,180
AUDIENCE: Hi.

715
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:06,760
Just had a question about the
Google+ Profiles API versus

716
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,930
the Google Profiles API.

717
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:15,290
Where it does seem that, if
you have a Google+ profile

718
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:19,540
that is locked for some reason
because you've contravened a

719
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:26,570
naming convention, then the user
in the Google Profiles

720
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:30,290
API is not returned, which
doesn't seem to be documented.

721
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:32,310
Is that just the
documentation?

722
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,130
VIC FRYZEL: I think that is
a documentation error.

723
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:35,350
I can help you get that fixed.

724
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,014
Sorry about that.

725
00:30:37,014 --> 00:30:38,010
Hi.

726
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:38,180
AUDIENCE: Hi.

727
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,720
So there have been a couple
questions about

728
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,550
quotas and the like.

729
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:43,070
And one of the reasons that's
been an issue for--

730
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,070
hasn't really been an issue
for us, but it could be a

731
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,900
potential issue is that the
result set size when trying to

732
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,945
get user information from the
Provisioning API previously

733
00:30:49,945 --> 00:30:54,285
has only been 100 results
per query.

734
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:57,690
Is that going to change
with this API?

735
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,372
VIC FRYZEL: I think
that's changing.

736
00:30:59,372 --> 00:31:00,720
It's 500 now.

737
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,180
AUDIENCE: 500?

738
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:01,640
Excellent.

739
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,020
Thanks.

740
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:03,530
VIC FRYZEL: Hey again.

741
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:04,380
AUDIENCE: Hi.

742
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:07,100
Do we have an Active Directory
equivalent coming out soon?

743
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,950
VIC FRYZEL: Forgive me,
I didn't hear you.

744
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,235
AUDIENCE: Active Directory
equivalent coming out soon for

745
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,182
Google Apps?

746
00:31:12,182 --> 00:31:14,140
VIC FRYZEL: I don't have
anything to announce today.

747
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,010
AUDIENCE: Active Directory
for Exchange.

748
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,540
There is an Active Directory
for Exchange,

749
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,400
so similar to that.

750
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,620
VIC FRYZEL: I'm familiar, but
I don't have anything to

751
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,726
announce today.

752
00:31:19,726 --> 00:31:20,976
Sorry.

753
00:31:20,976 --> 00:31:23,300

754
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,280
Other questions?

755
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,010
I think I told half of you in
the room to come find me

756
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:31,130
afterward, so it might
take a while.

757
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:34,330
But make sure that you come to
our Office Hours, which are on

758
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:37,040
the third floor.

759
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:37,900
A whole bunch of us
are going to be

760
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,190
there answering questions.

761
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:41,690
And then make sure to attend the
rest of the apps sessions

762
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:42,400
throughout the rest
of the day.

763
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,000
There's a lot of interesting
content.

764
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,020
Thank you very much.

765
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:50,630
[APPLAUSE]
