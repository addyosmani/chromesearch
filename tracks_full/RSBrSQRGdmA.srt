1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,880

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,255
JUSTIN BOYAN: Great.

3
00:00:02,255 --> 00:00:05,970
Hey, everybody, how you doing?

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,770
Everybody having fun?

5
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:08,830
We're having fun.

6
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:09,810
I'm Justin Boyan.

7
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,340
I'm a product manager in the
Google Cambridge, Mass office.

8
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,460
JOSH AIN: And I'm Josh Ain.

9
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,280
I'm a software engineer,
also in the

10
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,080
Google Cambridge office.

11
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,670
JUSTIN BOYAN: And we are going
to do a deep dive into four

12
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:26,030
tools that Google is providing
to help webmasters and people

13
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:30,370
who author HTML provide a
structured view of their data

14
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,840
to Google and other
search engines.

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,410
So before we get started, how
many of you actually have a

16
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,650
website or work for an

17
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,840
organization that has a website?

18
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,930
Who the heck doesn't
have a website?

19
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,600
How many of you have
written HTML for

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,650
that website or others?

21
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,810
Every kid these days knows
how to write HTML.

22
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:52,040
Now, how many of you have
included structured

23
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,160
markup in that HTML?

24
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,930
Microformats, microdata,
RDFa, OGP?

25
00:00:58,930 --> 00:00:59,570
About half.

26
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:00,810
Perfect.

27
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,390
So that's what we're seeing
on the web, as well.

28
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,300
And this talk we're going to
cover two kinds of tools.

29
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,400
Tools for those of you who have
already put structured

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,020
markup into your HTML, and those
of you who haven't yet

31
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:18,080
and need a little boost
getting started.

32
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,780
So four tools we're going
to demo are--

33
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,470
for those of you who already
have structured markup, the

34
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,580
Structured Data Testing Tool,
the Structured Data Dashboard.

35
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:34,390
And then for those of you who
are just getting started with

36
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,720
providing structured data on
your websites, the Data

37
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,470
Highlighter tool, which is
launched yesterday with seven

38
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,870
additional data types, and the
Structured Data Markup Helper,

39
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,860
an all new tool that
launched yesterday.

40
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:52,660
So just if you missed the last
session, I'm going to briefly

41
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,490
recap why are you interested
in providing a structured

42
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,430
semantic view of your
data to Google?

43
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,460
And it's because Google is going
well beyond the plain

44
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,430
vanilla 10 blue links in
response to search.

45
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,150
We want to provide answers,
anticipation, and enhanced

46
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,270
presentation of the results,
which we can do if we

47
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,410
understand the structure of the
data on your web pages.

48
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,270
So for starters, there
are rich snippets.

49
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,240
If you provide structured
information about your event

50
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,130
listings or your product
listings, your recipes, the

51
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,350
review content on your sites,
and other similar data

52
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:33,670
formats, we can highlight your
search results with enhanced

53
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,760
treatment that helps
users find what

54
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,400
they're looking for quicker.

55
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,710
For recipes, we go a bit further
and actually provide

56
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:43,910
search tools that allow users to
filter the results based on

57
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,410
the structured content
in your pages.

58
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:49,200
So certainly, if you're
searching for chocolate chip

59
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,260
cookie recipe, you want to
exclude the recipes with

60
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,900
pecans and walnuts because
that's an atrocity.

61
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,780
And we provide you the ability
to do that powered by

62
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,580
structured markup
in web pages.

63
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,490
We are integrating with the
Knowledge Graph, so if you

64
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:10,600
provide reviews of movies, say,
when a user searches for

65
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,650
a movie we can highlight that
data right in front and center

66
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:19,190
in the knowledge graph
presentation for that movie.

67
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,920
And for events, we've got
a lot of treatments.

68
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,190
So launching just a couple
days ago, is this events

69
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,170
carousel, we call it.

70
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,880
Somebody comes in searching
for events in a city--

71
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,410
I believe this was launched
US only--

72
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,970
we feature a nice carousel
of the most popular

73
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,920
events in that city.

74
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,960
We also, as Jason showed last
session, we'll blend in events

75
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:48,490
from web data into searches
for a band or for a venue.

76
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:53,190
And these event data items are
also showing up in mobile

77
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,440
interfaces like Google Now.

78
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,380
So to make your data eligible
to participate in all these

79
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,010
cool enhanced search treatments,
you need us to

80
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,280
understand the structure
of the data.

81
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,010
And there are many ways
of doing that.

82
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:13,080
Our number one recommendation
is to use microdata with

83
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,330
schema.org vocabulary.

84
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,990

85
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,010
What do you think?

86
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,649
Is that easy enough?

87
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:22,490
JOSH AIN: Looks difficult
to me, Justin.

88
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,310
JUSTIN BOYAN: Yeah, it's not
that bad, but we do recognize

89
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,690
there are many competing
formats.

90
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:34,260
There are microformats,
microdata, RDFa, OGP, et

91
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,660
cetera, and it can be confusing
for webmasters to

92
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,760
know exactly what they're
supposed to do and what

93
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,720
they're supposed to provide.

94
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,510
So that's where our team is
working hard to try to make

95
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,930
things easier.

96
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,830
So let's get into the demos.

97
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,010
We'll start with the two tools
that help you check existing

98
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:55,880
markup that you've already
applied to web pages.

99
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,040
The structured data testing
tool, this is the situation

100
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,330
where you have a single web
page, you want to check if

101
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,040
you've applied markup
the right way.

102
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,240
It's a validation tool.

103
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,720
Anybody can go use this tool.

104
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,360
You don't even need
to be logged in.

105
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,090
You go to the Webmaster Tools
Rich Snippets site, paste in

106
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:17,720
the URL or actually, the source
HTML of your page, and

107
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,750
Google will show you what we
understand of the structured

108
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,410
data on that page.

109
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:27,630
So to demonstrate this tool I
have brought on the pretend

110
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,450
webmaster for a local museum,
the San Francisco Museum of

111
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,720
Modern Art.

112
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,800
We don't actually have a
preexisting relationship with

113
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,280
SFMOMA, but just for demo
purposes, Josh will pretend to

114
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,790
be the SFMOMA webmaster.

115
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,040
JOSH AIN: One second.

116
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,780

117
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,370
So hello.

118
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,660
As you can clearly see by my
hat, I'm the webmaster of the

119
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,910
San Francisco Museum
of Modern Art.

120
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:55,800
Just kidding.

121
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,110
I don't actually have any
knowledge of whether the

122
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,790
webmaster of San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art wears a

123
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,920
hat like this or does any of the
other things I'm going to

124
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,340
do, but for the purpose of
motivating this example I'm

125
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,700
talking about the motivations
of this webmaster.

126
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,540
So I have events going on at
the San Francisco Museum of

127
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,720
Modern Art and I would like to
make sure that as many people

128
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,750
as possible know about these
upcoming events.

129
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,600
If you're staying in town next
week after Google I/O or if

130
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,870
you live here, we've got a
great event going on, the

131
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,250
Agent Ruby files.

132
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,370
This is based on an AI
art and exploration

133
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,490
project that goes on.

134
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,870
And I think it's really
interesting.

135
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,610
So if you're here, you
should check it out.

136
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,550
I want to make sure everybody
knows about that, and I want

137
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,910
Google to share details
about this event.

138
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,210
JUSTIN BOYAN: But we're
not showing rich

139
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,720
snippets for that event.

140
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,230
JOSH AIN: Right, we're not
showing rich snippets right

141
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,370
now, I know that.

142
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,670
And I want to figure out why.

143
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,940
So I've already added
structured

144
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,250
markup to this page.

145
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,340
And I'm going to take the URL
of this event and go over to

146
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,160
the Google Structured Data
Testing tool and

147
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,300
paste in this URL.

148
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,220
I could also paste in
HTML if I hadn't

149
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,070
published the URL yet.

150
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,600
And I'll say Preview.

151
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,200
So here, I see the search
treatment which I already know

152
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,620
I'm getting for the event.

153
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,500
And it's just a normal
search result.

154
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,620
There's nothing event-specific
about it.

155
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,680
If I scroll down further, I can
see that Google does pick

156
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,060
up the structured data that I've
added to the site, so why

157
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,580
isn't my event showing up?

158
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,920
JUSTIN BOYAN: Well, you've got
your microformats there.

159
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,110
You've shown the start date and
summary and description of

160
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,210
the event, but you haven't given
us a location we can

161
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,230
understand.

162
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:36,180
JOSH AIN: Ah, so here I can
learn that I need to add the

163
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,950
location and then maybe I
can get event treatment.

164
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,130
Let's try that out.

165
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:43,140
JUSTIN BOYAN: So if the real
webmaster of SFMOMA were to go

166
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,950
back and fix up the microformat
to connect in the

167
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:49,490
location properly, then
re-previewing in the

168
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:54,070
Structured Data Testing
tool would show that--

169
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:58,110
there you go-- the rich snippet
line, which shows

170
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,270
clearly the date and location
of that event.

171
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:05,370
And also, seeing that preview in
the rich snippet will also

172
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,450
indicate that Google has
understood the data in a way

173
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,570
that's usable and makes the
event eligible for all the

174
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,450
other search presentations
of events.

175
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:13,800
JOSH AIN: There we go.

176
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,420
That's much better.

177
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,090
That's exactly what I want.

178
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,110
Thanks.

179
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,620
JUSTIN BOYAN: We'll move on to
the Structured Data Dashboard.

180
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,570
So this goes beyond single
page validation.

181
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,110
Here again, you are a webmaster
who has already

182
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:31,280
applied markup to your site,
perhaps over a variety of

183
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,929
different pages and a variety
of different types.

184
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:36,940
And you would like to understand
holistically

185
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,760
whether Google is picking
up your data correctly.

186
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,289
So log into Webmaster Tools,
which you need

187
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,710
to be verified for.

188
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,880
And go to the Structured
Data Dashboard.

189
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,190
To demonstrate that, I'll bring

190
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,900
back my SFMOMA webmaster.

191
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,040
JOSH AIN: Hello, I'm still the
webmaster at San Francisco

192
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,150
Museum of Modern Art.

193
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:00,840
And I'm going to go into my
Structured Data Dashboard.

194
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,610
Here it is.

195
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,750
I'm already a verified
webmaster

196
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,330
of my site, of course.

197
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,950
And I can see Google's
understanding of the

198
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,070
structured data on my
site over time.

199
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,010
So I haven't made any
significant changes to my

200
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:15,680
structured data recently, and
that's why these lines are

201
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,240
pretty flat.

202
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,960
But if I just added a lot of
structured data, you could see

203
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,880
when Google re-crawls the site
and when Google picks it up.

204
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,180
I can also see what
Google knows.

205
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,270
Google knows about 23 and 1/2
thousand items split over 15

206
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:31,440
and 1/2 thousand pages.

207
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,710
And they're split into two
different types of structured

208
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:37,000
data, hCards, or contact
information, and

209
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,080
hCalendars, or events.

210
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,300
And I've got 9,000 events.

211
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,770
If I want more details on
Google's understanding, I can

212
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:47,220
just drill in here and see a
bunch of different example

213
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,480
pages that have hCalendars
and Google's

214
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,080
interpretation of them.

215
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,320
Now, to go back to the example
we were looking at, I know

216
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,450
that the URL of the Agent Ruby
files ends in 2295, because as

217
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,660
a good webmaster,
I've memorized

218
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,690
every URL on my website.

219
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:07,090
And so I have the Agent
Ruby files.

220
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,370
I can see that that's
the same page we

221
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,890
were looking at earlier.

222
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:15,000
And when I click on it, we'll
bring up the details.

223
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,640
Here they are.

224
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,640
We'll bring up the details of
Google's understanding.

225
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,960
So, similar to what I saw
earlier in the testing tool,

226
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,590
only now I can easily see it on
lots of different pages one

227
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,260
after another.

228
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,850
JUSTIN BOYAN: So it's
essentially like applying the

229
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,890
Structured Data Testing tool
to your whole site

230
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,340
simultaneously and getting
an overview.

231
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,690
And right now the Dashboard
team is hard at work

232
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,310
integrating error information in
a really nice way into that

233
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,020
Dashboard display.

234
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,900
You'll be seeing that roll out
early this summer, I hope,

235
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,200
although we don't like to
pre-announce things.

236
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,580
But here's a mock of what
it's going to look like.

237
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,690
So it features quite clearly
along the top row what

238
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,980
different classes of errors
we've observed in your

239
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,480
structured data markup, and then
we surface those pages

240
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,300
with errors on them
to the top.

241
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,690
So the idea is to really help
webmasters debug problems in

242
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,020
their markup so that Google
can understand it clearly.

243
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,700

244
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,320
So that concludes the first
half of tools that we're

245
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,390
providing to people who
are already using

246
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,810
markup on their pages.

247
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,310
Now, let's shift gears to those
of you who don't yet

248
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:23,620
have markup and aren't yet
explaining your structured

249
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,230
data to Google.

250
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,100
How do you get Google--

251
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,220
how do you start participating
in all the enhanced features

252
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,680
that structured data enables?

253
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,420
We're going to show two
fancy and slick tools.

254
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,820
The first is Data Highlighter.

255
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,710
Data Highlighter launched
in December for events.

256
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,680
As of yesterday, it is now
available for seven additional

257
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,950
types of data, almost all of the
rich snippet data formats

258
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,530
that Google supports.

259
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:53,550
Data Highlighter is a tool
that's, like the Dashboard,

260
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:56,890
built into Webmaster Tools,
and allows you, without

261
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:01,090
actually changing the HTML of
your pages at all, to get a

262
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:05,200
taste of what structured markup
could do for you.

263
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,700
So how can Google get an
understanding of your

264
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,430
structured data without you
editing your HTML at all?

265
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:15,382
It works by machine learning
and a point and click UI.

266
00:12:15,382 --> 00:12:19,730
So you actually start with a
sample page that contains the

267
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:22,350
kind of data you would like
Google to understand.

268
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,400
You apply a point and click
tagging operation to label the

269
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,130
key data fields on
those pages.

270
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,810
And then Google extrapolates the
pattern of the tags that

271
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,080
you've applied to other similar
pages on your website.

272
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,930
So we'll have Josh demonstrate
how the Data

273
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,020
Highlighter tool works.

274
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,060
But let's bring in a different
webmaster.

275
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:48,070
I'd like to call up the
webmaster of the 826 Valencia

276
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,690
Pirate Supply Store.

277
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:50,270
JOSH AIN: Hold on.

278
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,520
Let me get him.

279
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:56,440

280
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,430
Arr.

281
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:02,620
I'm the webmaster of 826
Valencia, San Francisco's only

282
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,290
independent pirate
supply store.

283
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,880
And so I hope if you have any
pirate supply needs while

284
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,750
you're in town, you
know where to go.

285
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,030
As an independent--

286
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,980
now, again, I'm not really
the webmaster.

287
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,460
This is just for example,
explaining how somebody might

288
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,490
use this tool.

289
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:21,830
So I'm a busy shop owner.

290
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:24,570
I don't have a lot of time
to go and add every

291
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,990
feature to my website.

292
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,550
What I care about is making
sure people know about my

293
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:32,510
store, know what's in stock,
and know about

294
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,660
my important events.

295
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,160
So Talk Like a Pirate Day is
coming right up and people

296
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,270
need their pirate
gear for that.

297
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,150
I want to make sure that they
can find all of my products on

298
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,490
Google when I do that.

299
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,830
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to take my URL--

300
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,600
a URL for one of my favorite
products, the Hook--

301
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,400
copy it, and go into Webmaster
Tools Data Highlighter.

302
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,050
So that's just under
Optimization.

303
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:59,310
And I'm a verified webmaster,
of course.

304
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,050
But I just don't have time
to add all of the

305
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,120
markup to my page.

306
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,940
I'm going to train Google
how to fetch the data.

307
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:09,580
So I'm going to paste the URL
in for my hook and choose a

308
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,080
type of data I want
to highlight.

309
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,260
So this is a product.

310
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,160
I want to tell people
how to buy it.

311
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,840
And I want to tag this page
and others like it.

312
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,820
I just want to tag all the
product pages on my site.

313
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,950
So let's get started.

314
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,360
JUSTIN BOYAN: So once you've
told us about that first

315
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,960
sample URL, we're going to
load the page in and

316
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,990
instrument it for this point and
click tagging operation.

317
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,920
JOSH AIN: So I can see, here
on the right are the fields

318
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,240
that Google's interested
in about a product.

319
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,820
So a name, an image,
price information.

320
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,640
And here's my web page, along
with some guidance on what I

321
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,030
have to do to share this data.

322
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:48,340
So I'm going to just highlight
this hook,

323
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,970
the name of my product.

324
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:53,920
And then I get this interface
that lets me tell Google what

325
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,260
this data means.

326
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,900
So this is the name
of my product.

327
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:02,264
Down here we have a price.

328
00:15:02,264 --> 00:15:05,590
And here's an image
for my hook.

329
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:08,190
And I think that's enough
information.

330
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,480
There's other fields, but I
don't have ratings or reviews

331
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,950
on my site, so I think
that's enough.

332
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,325
I'll click Done.

333
00:15:15,325 --> 00:15:16,500
What's this, Justin?

334
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,990
JUSTIN BOYAN: At this point,
we're looking at the structure

335
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:22,310
of your website and finding a
URL pattern that seems to

336
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:25,760
contain similarly formatted
web pages.

337
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,250
And so in this case, we're
guessing that the slash store

338
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,010
slash product slash star might
be the set of pages that

339
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,210
you're interested in
sharing with us.

340
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:37,300
JOSH AIN: So as any good
webmaster or shop owner knows,

341
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,770
I know all the URLs on my
website, and I know that all

342
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,920
of my products fall under
that pattern, so it

343
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,415
looks great to me.

344
00:15:43,415 --> 00:15:46,340
I'm going to create a page
set and keep going.

345
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,940
JUSTIN BOYAN: Now, at this
point, we're going to suggest

346
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,600
a few more examples of pages
from within that URL pattern

347
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,870
and get him to confirm
that we've

348
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,320
understood them correctly.

349
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,710
We'll try and look for pages
that maybe don't fit the

350
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,840
pattern, are formatted
a little differently.

351
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,610
JOSH AIN: So here I can see the
powder horn, which is $38.

352
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:05,550
And the data that I expect is
showing up here on the right,

353
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,290
indicating Google's
understanding.

354
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,180
Looks good to me.

355
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,770
I'll click Next.

356
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,370
The seahose.

357
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:15,100
Also looks like Google
understands what that means.

358
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,040
I'll click Next.

359
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,240
Holiday card bundle.

360
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,146
Looks good to me.

361
00:16:23,146 --> 00:16:26,280
And individual signs.

362
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,970
Yep, just $4.

363
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,340
So I guess I'm done with
five examples.

364
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,460
JUSTIN BOYAN: It doesn't always
go that smoothly, but

365
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,540
you're training a pattern
recognition system.

366
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,500
So if your site has more
variability than this one, you

367
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,500
may have to clear some of our
incorrectly guessed tags and

368
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,960
correctly reapply those tags.

369
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,040
But generally, after five or
sometimes 10 pages, we will

370
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,420
have understood your pattern and
you can click through to

371
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,620
the next phase.

372
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,005
JOSH AIN: Great.

373
00:16:53,005 --> 00:16:55,740
I'll click Done and
keep going.

374
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,200
JUSTIN BOYAN: So this
is the final review.

375
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,860
We provide a wider sample of
pages that you can quickly

376
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,730
skim through, just to check.

377
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,920
Again, sanity check that we're
pulling the right information

378
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,980
from the set of pages
you gave us.

379
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,040
JOSH AIN: So, I see.

380
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,869
I can just review all
of these pages.

381
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:16,089
And all of these look like the
products I have in stock.

382
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:18,690
It doesn't look like Google
has made any mistakes.

383
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:19,849
So I'm done.

384
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:21,920
JUSTIN BOYAN: Yeah,
hit Publish.

385
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,460
And that will actually install
the pattern recognition into

386
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,319
the Google crawling algorithms,
so that in the

387
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,790
future as we gather updated
information from your site we

388
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,160
will interpret that structured
data as if you had applied

389
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,070
markup to the pages directly.

390
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,060
JOSH AIN: But when do
I get snippets?

391
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,900
I want to make sure that I
have them for Talk Like a

392
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,820
Pirate Day.

393
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,960
JUSTIN BOYAN: Well, as we
re-crawl your site, those

394
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,680
snippets will start appearing.

395
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,980
I think talk like a
Pirate Day is--

396
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:47,330
when?

397
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:47,980
JOSH AIN: September.

398
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,350
JUSTIN BOYAN: Yeah,
you'll be fine.

399
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:49,900
JOSH AIN: Great.

400
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,150
Thanks a lot, Justin.

401
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,440

402
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,740
JUSTIN BOYAN: So again, Data
Highlighter, as of yesterday,

403
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,500
supports eight types of data.

404
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,450
That's in addition to events,
articles, local businesses,

405
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:06,430
movies and movie reviews,
products, as you just saw,

406
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:10,210
restaurants, software
applications, and TV episodes.

407
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,910
So if your website has any of
those kinds of data on it, you

408
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:18,550
can get a quick jump into the
world of structured data by

409
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,580
applying Data Highlighter,
as you just saw.

410
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:25,830
You don't even need to modify
your actual website.

411
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,970
Of course, there's a downside
to using Data Highlighter,

412
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:32,730
which is only Google will have
that pattern recognition

413
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,390
installed after you
do this process.

414
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:37,240
So it will make your snippets
available on Google, but it's

415
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,660
not nicely sharing that data
with the rest of the open web.

416
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,450
And we're sensitive to that.

417
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,460
We recommend that you do
transition to implementing

418
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,960
full markup on your
site when you can.

419
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,480
But having said that, it is a
great and easy way to get

420
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,500
started exploring what markup
will do for your site.

421
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,980
When you are ready to transition
to markup, we are

422
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:05,020
announcing as of today a new
tool, Structured Data Markup

423
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,260
Helper, which is also available
for all those same

424
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:11,030
data types you just saw
in Data Highlighter.

425
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:14,630
You again, apply the same
point and click tagging

426
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:17,860
operation to a sample web
page on your site.

427
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,430
And this time, instead of trying
to fancily learn the

428
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,680
pattern of your whole site
what we're going to do is

429
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,090
recommend microdata and
schema.org markup that you can

430
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:30,750
then copy into your
HTML source.

431
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,840
So to demonstrate how Structured
Data Markup Helper

432
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,750
works, I'd like to send away
the pirate and bring on the

433
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,980
web master-- the pretend
webmaster of the Computer

434
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,590
History Museum down
in Mountain View.

435
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,590
JOSH AIN: Hello, everybody.

436
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,940
As you can clearly see by my
Nintendo Entertainment System

437
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,430
hat, I'm the webmaster of the
Computer History Museum.

438
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:56,320
I'm a big aficionado of
all things computer.

439
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,690
I'm not actually
the webmaster.

440
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:02,540
I'm not sure that he has this
hat, but I hope he does.

441
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:07,020
Regardless, I'm very excited
about structured markup.

442
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,040
I have events on my site.

443
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,270
I want to share them
with the world.

444
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:13,750
But there's a lot going on in
the Computer History Museum,

445
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,980
and I haven't had time to
add the markup yet.

446
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,370
And I'm really excited for
Google to help me do that.

447
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:22,790
Now, I know a lot about the
history of computers and I see

448
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,450
where we're going.

449
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,920
And I see structured markup as
the future of computing on the

450
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,230
web, and I want the Computer
History Museum to be part of

451
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,830
that, for sure.

452
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:34,570
So to get started, I'm going
to take this URL of my

453
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:37,220
upcoming events, copy
it, and go into the

454
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,160
Structured Markup Helper.

455
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,040
So here in the Structured Data
Markup Helper I'll paste in my

456
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,480
URL into this field.

457
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,210
I could also paste in HTML if
was building a new site and

458
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,780
hadn't put it online yet.

459
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,440
And then choose what type
of data I want to tag.

460
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,680
So here I want to tag events.

461
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,120
Once I'm done with that, I'll
go ahead and start tagging.

462
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,960
JUSTIN BOYAN: We'll instrument
the page for point and click

463
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,790
tagging, just like we did
in Data Highlighter.

464
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:09,830

465
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:10,530
JOSH AIN: So here we go.

466
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,580
That's the same page that
we were just looking at.

467
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,220
And I've got my fields for
events, the fields that

468
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,430
Google's interested
in for an event.

469
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:20,360
So I'll go ahead and highlight
my first event.

470
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,780
There's the name.

471
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,030
There's the date.

472
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,540

473
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,745
Here's an image to go
with the event.

474
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:31,950
And I think that's enough.

475
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,240
JUSTIN BOYAN: Yeah, well,
you've got multiple

476
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,220
events on that page.

477
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,290
I'm afraid you're going to
have to keep on tagging.

478
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:36,805
JOSH AIN: OK.

479
00:21:36,805 --> 00:21:38,055
We'll do my second one.

480
00:21:38,055 --> 00:21:40,610

481
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,800
And oh, what just happened
there, Justin?

482
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,980
JUSTIN BOYAN: A little
bit of magic.

483
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:47,480
When we recognize there's a
repeated structure of HTML on

484
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,200
your page, we'll go ahead and
automatically suggest the rest

485
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,540
of the tags on that page, so you
don't need to do them all

486
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,910
one by one.

487
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:55,670
JOSH AIN: So that looks right.

488
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:58,280
Looking at the tags, it looks
like the whole page is filled

489
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,710
in with all of my events.

490
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:02,060
And even notice that the first
two events have images but

491
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,910
subsequent events did not.

492
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,980
And it was OK with that.

493
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:10,630
Looking at the right I can
review my data, and all of my

494
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,160
events are there.

495
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,290
So I guess I'm done.

496
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,010
JUSTIN BOYAN: Go ahead
in create HTML.

497
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:19,150
And here's where we'll show you
sample markup that you can

498
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,360
go ahead and apply
to your site.

499
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,870
So you'll see highlighted in
yellow on the right-hand side

500
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,410
all our recommended additions.

501
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:32,010
So scrolling down there you see
we have suggested an item

502
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:36,440
type of schema.org/event and
several item props for the

503
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:42,390
date and name and image
on those events.

504
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:42,860
JOSH AIN: So it looks great.

505
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,970
JUSTIN BOYAN: You can also see
we've shown you how to

506
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:48,000
normalize the date into the
recommended schema.org ISO

507
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,430
8601 format.

508
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:50,930
JOSH AIN: That's great.

509
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:54,530
And I can just take these new
sections and add them to my

510
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:57,600
templating system, and then
I'll have markup.

511
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,310
JUSTIN BOYAN: Right on.

512
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,620
JOSH AIN: Now, is this
everything that I need, then?

513
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,840
I'm done?

514
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,120
JUSTIN BOYAN: Well, let me tell
you about an unfortunate

515
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,950
experience that my friend at
the San Francisco Museum of

516
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:07,850
Modern Art had.

517
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:08,580
JOSH AIN: Ohm I know him well.

518
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,340
He's a good guy.

519
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,920
JUSTIN BOYAN: Yeah, well,
he didn't connect up the

520
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,970
locations to his events
properly.

521
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,850
I think you better go back
and add location.

522
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,500
JOSH AIN: Let's see if
we can fix that.

523
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,580
So I've got the location up
here, the Computer History

524
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,950
Museum,

525
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:22,320
JUSTIN BOYAN: Oh, god,
that's an image.

526
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,540
How's going to work?

527
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:26,290
JOSH AIN: So I'll tag that
as the location name.

528
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:29,580
JUSTIN BOYAN: Yes, in this
case, the alt text on the

529
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:33,910
image, as frequently is the
case, corresponds to the

530
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,900
semantic content of what
that image represents.

531
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,010
So we've just pulled
the alt text in.

532
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:42,840
We also noticed that it was
structurally outside the scope

533
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,220
of the events on the page, and
so we've distributed that

534
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:48,280
location down and put it
in each of the events.

535
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:48,940
JOSH AIN: Oh, good, yeah.

536
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,670
It's in each of my events
rather than

537
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:51,550
just the first event.

538
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,370
Perfect.

539
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:53,140
JUSTIN BOYAN: Right.

540
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,460
JOSH AIN: Let's see the
HTML that creates.

541
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:55,790
JUSTIN BOYAN: Right.

542
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:58,940
So here it's become a little bit
more complicated because

543
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:02,720
of the non-hierarchical nature,
the non self-contained

544
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,060
nature of the events.

545
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:07,580
So the recommended markup
uses a feature of

546
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,890
microdata called itemref.

547
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:13,230
So it shows you how
to do that.

548
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:16,050
Little more complicated, but
still gives you something to

549
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:21,070
work from as you implement
markup on your site.

550
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,420
JOSH AIN: Looks great to me.

551
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,450
Thanks, Justin.

552
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:23,640
JUSTIN BOYAN: Yes.

553
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,310
That is the Structured
Data Markup Helper.

554
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:29,190
It is available to any logged
in Google user.

555
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,680
You do not need to
be a webmaster

556
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,920
to use Markup Helper.

557
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,650
It, like I said before, is
available for the same eight

558
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,200
data types the Data
Highlighter is.

559
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,960
So there they are
on the screen.

560
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,690
In addition, we are supporting
the smart email schemas that

561
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:48,590
were announced yesterday
and will be discussed

562
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,320
further this afternoon.

563
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,680
So if you want to annotate an
HTML email with information

564
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,810
about a flight reservation or
a hotel reservation, things

565
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:00,930
like that, this tool will
help you add markup to

566
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,790
that email as well.

567
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:05,780
And that will output in JSON-LD

568
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,740
format, as well as microdata.

569
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,660
JOSH AIN: So that's
very exciting.

570
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,220
I believe there are sessions at
2:15, or somewhere around

571
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:11,900
then this afternoon.

572
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,180
You should definitely check
it out, as well.

573
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,880
JUSTIN BOYAN: So that basically

574
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,210
concludes our four demos.

575
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:22,550
Again, in summary, we've got
two tools that help you

576
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:25,770
validate markup that you've
already applied to your site.

577
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:28,680
We've got Data Highlighter that
lets you test the waters

578
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,320
of structured markup by very
quickly, without even having

579
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,360
the access or the time to modify
your website, show

580
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,960
Google how to understand it.

581
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,640
And when you are ready to start
adding markup at first,

582
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,270
there's the new Markup Helper.

583
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:47,290
And that's all we've got.

584
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,760
We would be very happy
to take questions.

585
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,135
JOSH AIN: And we also
have some shirts for

586
00:25:51,135 --> 00:25:53,020
you on the way out.

587
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,850
Would you like to show them
the shirts, Justin?

588
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:57,410
JUSTIN BOYAN: Yes, without--

589
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:58,880
JOSH AIN: It's this
flannel shirt.

590
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,606
No, just kidding.

591
00:26:00,606 --> 00:26:03,938
Nice flannel shirts.

592
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:07,800
JUSTIN BOYAN: Don't you worry
about a schema.org/Thing.

593
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,570
JOSH AIN: So those are on the
way out, if you're interested.

594
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:10,820
Thank you.

595
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:15,800

596
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,420
AUDIENCE: Hi.

597
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:19,950
Let's say I work for a large
retailer that has hundreds of

598
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:22,420
thousands of products
on the web.

599
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:26,210
Can you help me give a business
case to my bosses to

600
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:29,040
tell them, we really need
to open this up.

601
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:34,190
Obviously, it's creating a new
available marketplace of

602
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:37,380
getting just the information
out there for all people to

603
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,600
consume that data is one
of the big reasons.

604
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,590
Are there other ways that you
would recommend doing that?

605
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:47,480
JOSH AIN: So just repeat the
question, I think what I heard

606
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,960
was, working for a big retailer

607
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,780
with lots of products.

608
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,650
How do you make the business
case for the value of adding

609
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,390
this markup and what
it gets you.

610
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,180
Is that right?

611
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,590
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

612
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:00,610
JUSTIN BOYAN: The basic sell
is enhanced presentation in

613
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:01,860
search results.

614
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,010

615
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:08,080
So if you're a retailer and
when your organic search

616
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,475
results don't show that
product and price rich

617
00:27:10,475 --> 00:27:12,940
snippet, then you're missing
out on the chance to really

618
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,470
show people my product's
in stock.

619
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,910
This is the cost
of my product.

620
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:21,770
It's really for sale and it's
got a four star review.

621
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:28,990
So the intent is to make the
more relevant data available

622
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:31,640
to users so the people who come
to your site are knowing

623
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,760
what they're getting.

624
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,220
AUDIENCE: So it's
one less click.

625
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,150
So they don't have to click
through to see that same

626
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:37,790
information.

627
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,970
JOSH AIN: They don't have to
click through, but also,

628
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:42,280
you're giving them a reason to
click through by telling them

629
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,200
it's in stock and providing
the other important

630
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,410
information, the information
that we find people are most

631
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:49,750
likely to look for to entice
them to click on your links

632
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:52,690
and come to your site.

633
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:53,370
AUDIENCE: Hi.

634
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:57,400
Just a quick question about how
you handling JavaScript.

635
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:57,970
JOSH AIN: OK.

636
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:58,920
Yeah, we do our best.

637
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:03,570
So are you talking about in
Data Highlighter or??

638
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:06,180
AUDIENCE: Yeah, because a lot of
data and especially images

639
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:09,310
are provided dynamically
through JavaScript.

640
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:12,470
JUSTIN BOYAN: Yeah, we do our
best to actually execute the

641
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:17,630
JavaScript and provide you
access to the rendered version

642
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:20,300
of the page, post JavaScript.

643
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,300
JOSH AIN: At a technical level,
we're not showing you

644
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,360
the raw HTML.

645
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,500
We are rendering the page
in a browser and then

646
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,440
showing that to you.

647
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,660
So it doesn't work 100% of the
time, but most of the time if

648
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,630
you have JavaScript that's
executing on load to show

649
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:36,660
images, et cetera, those will
show up in the version that we

650
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,500
display in Data Highlighter
and Markup Helper.

651
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,810
AUDIENCE: And if we have
navigation through images, is

652
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,240
that something you would--

653
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,340
I mean, you don't actually
follow navigation, do you?

654
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,960
JUSTIN BOYAN: We don't follow
navigation, that's right.

655
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,240
JOSH AIN: Right.

656
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,750
So we do allow you to tag a
link, if that's an important

657
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,880
piece of information.

658
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,750
But we're not navigating
the site.

659
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,420

660
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,840
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm [INAUDIBLE].

661
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,510
And my question is, with
relation to the last example,

662
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:07,620
so you applied the structured
markup to a list of events.

663
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:11,340
I wanted to know one, what is
the best practice there versus

664
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,290
putting the markup
on your list page

665
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,280
versus the detail page?

666
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,440
And in the search results,
is it going to

667
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,990
link the list page?

668
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,120
JUSTIN BOYAN: Great question.

669
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,250
Both.

670
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:26,580
We recommend you do
both, if you can.

671
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:31,810
So the listing pages often are
higher ranked in search and

672
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:33,480
are going to get more views.

673
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,990
And so it's great if
the structured data

674
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,520
is available there.

675
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,530
For events in particular,
there is a rich snippet

676
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:42,030
treatment that will show
multiple events associated

677
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,620
with a single page up to, I
forget, three or four of them,

678
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,640
but will provide
separate links.

679
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,010
From the list page, it'll
actually provide multiple

680
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:54,220
links right off that snippet
into the details pages.

681
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,870

682
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,310
AUDIENCE: So if you're showing
something like let's say,

683
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:05,770
restaurants, I can show basic
restaurant data on the list

684
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,610
page in the structured markup.

685
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:12,060
Should I also show reviews in
that markup, or should I limit

686
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:16,880
that to let's say, the
detail page markup?

687
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,520
JUSTIN BOYAN: I honestly don't
know the answer to that.

688
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:22,610
I know for a details page that
markup will be featured.

689
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:26,120
And I'm not sure whether
multiple reviews on a listing

690
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,970
page would get a special
treatment in the rich snippet

691
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,250
for that listing page.

692
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:30,930
I'm not sure.

693
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:33,580
JOSH AIN: But there's the
picture of what happens right

694
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,960
now with Google and there's the
picture of what's going to

695
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,590
happen in six months.

696
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:40,630
I think that the more structured
data that we all

697
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:44,210
add to the web, the more we can
do with structured data.

698
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:47,360
And so we have motivations that
are current, and then the

699
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,700
more data that accumulates we
can add more motivations and

700
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,950
more uses of it.

701
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,220

702
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,990
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name
is [INAUDIBLE].

703
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:59,590
I'm working a large e-commerce
platform.

704
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:05,740
So I'd like to know, with this
structured data, if you add

705
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:11,520
some specific data like stock
and it's very dynamic, how

706
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:18,420
often is it queried or things
to show accurate data?

707
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:22,270

708
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:26,300
Is there any special treatment
for very dynamic data?

709
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,320
JUSTIN BOYAN: For very
dynamic data.

710
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:32,380
I think the Google crawl
is very dynamic.

711
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:37,300
So we are just responding to the
data as we see it in the

712
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,890
Google crawl, but the crawl
itself is very dynamic and

713
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:44,370
does a lot of self-adjusting
depending on the kind of site

714
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:48,660
and how often we detect that its
core content is updating.

715
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:53,180
So in that sense, it depends
on your site and the

716
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:57,470
properties of the crawl, but we
can't really influence that

717
00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:00,290
much based on structured data.

718
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:03,000
AUDIENCE: On the website, is
there a plan to add this

719
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,790
structured data to products
like AdWords?

720
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:12,320
For the textiles, sometimes
it's very difficult to

721
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,180
generate a specific textile
for each group.

722
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:18,000
So it could be a good idea.

723
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,640
JUSTIN BOYAN: That is
a great idea for a

724
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,650
future Google product.

725
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,770
JOSH AIN: So you're saying to
generate ads based on the

726
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:25,550
structured data on your--

727
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:31,740
AUDIENCE: Yes, like a schema
textile, like a template and

728
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:37,040
filter is like an improvement
for a keyboard insertion.

729
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,030
JUSTIN BOYAN: I think it's a
wonderful idea to have that

730
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:43,580
sort of collaboration, but
there's no announcement of

731
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,940
anything like that planned,
as far as I know.

732
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,190
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

733
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,570

734
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:51,530
AUDIENCE: Are there plans to
add more data types or

735
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:54,020
potentially let users define
their own objects with the

736
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:58,250
data points, and then highlight
them and map them?

737
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,210
JUSTIN BOYAN: Yeah,
there aren't--

738
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:04,110
we haven't thought about letting
users extend that set

739
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:09,860
of types that are available to
tag, but there certainly are

740
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,650
plans for us to expand
that list.

741
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:15,790
We're basically growing this
product from scratch and

742
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:18,820
trying to get a sense of how
accurate the data is that

743
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,690
comes in through it.

744
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:25,030
And we're also careful not to
get too far ahead of ourselves

745
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,980
in exposing schemas
that Google isn't

746
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,970
making much use of yet.

747
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:32,560
So we don't want to make people
do a bunch of work--

748
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,330
AUDIENCE: How long has the Data

749
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:34,430
Highlighter been available?

750
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,750
This is the first I actually
had heard of it.

751
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,000
JUSTIN BOYAN: Yeah, it launched
in December, quietly

752
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,670
with a blog post on the
Webmaster Central blog.

753
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:47,500
And as of yesterday, it's
expanded just beyond events to

754
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,820
these eight data types.

755
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,830
It's also available
in 40 languages.

756
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,300
AUDIENCE: One last question.

757
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,420
What are some of the biggest
challenges that you still have

758
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,370
to solve for that potentially
Google or other

759
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,420
people could help with?

760
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,770
JUSTIN BOYAN: Biggest
challenges?

761
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:05,400
AUDIENCE: You mentioned that
it's not perfect, some pages

762
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:05,890
won't work.

763
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:08,530
Are there any specific things
that the community could help

764
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:11,510
with in any fashion?

765
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:14,380
JUSTIN BOYAN: Well, the Data
Highlighter tool, which is

766
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:17,239
machine learning based, there's
always going to be a

767
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:19,699
limit to what a pattern
recognition tool can do,

768
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:23,350
especially if your site is
excitingly variable.

769
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:27,750
So markup is always the safer
choice, where you can be very

770
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:30,659
specific and explicit about what
the data is on each and

771
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:34,469
every page regardless of
how it's formatted.

772
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:37,429
Nevertheless, we're always
working to improve the pattern

773
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:40,449
recognition so it does work
more smoothly on a higher

774
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:43,390
percentage of sites.

775
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:47,350
With Markup Helper there's a
challenge, because actually,

776
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:50,770
there are many ways to generate
the structured markup

777
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:52,929
for a given page.

778
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:55,570
And so we're continuing
to refine that.

779
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:57,750
This is an initial launch, but
we're looking at Ways to

780
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:01,170
simplify its output, always
generate the easiest, most

781
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:03,570
intuitive form of the markup.

782
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:05,600
So that's another focus.

783
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,330
JOSH AIN: The other piece that
I'd just add to your earlier

784
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:10,430
point, Data Highlighter was
launched in December.

785
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:13,320
Markup Helper launched today.

786
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,460
Structured Data Dashboard
launched last summer.

787
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,820
There's a lot of work
going on here.

788
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,400
We're trying to improve the
experience and we understand

789
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,350
that there's a lot of options.

790
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,290
We want to make it
easier for you.

791
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:27,250
So if you have pain points using
structured data that are

792
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,220
not being addressed,
come talk to us.

793
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,420
We'd love to learn about them.

794
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,390
JUSTIN BOYAN: Yeah, and we will
be, after lunch, at the

795
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:35,860
third floor Knowledge Sandbox.

796
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:40,040
And also, there is the Webmaster
Tools forum which is

797
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,570
open, and that's where we
monitor people's feedback on

798
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:45,710
these tools.

799
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,190
AUDIENCE: Sorry,
it's me again.

800
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:51,420
Is the structured data that you
put into the site, is that

801
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,840
going to be pulled into stuff
like Maps and some of the

802
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,980
other things that we're shown
with regards to Google+ and

803
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,230
stuff like that?

804
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:59,390

805
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:02,790
JUSTIN BOYAN: We are sensitive
about pulling data from

806
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:06,400
people's web pages out of the
context of those web pages,

807
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,920
because we realize we're
in an ecosystem.

808
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,620
But having said that, we are
always looking for the best

809
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,430
possible user experience.

810
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:19,860
So we want to do the best job
of both answering user's

811
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:25,970
questions and directing them to
the authoritative owners of

812
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,380
web content.

813
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,640
So yes.

814
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,120
JOSH AIN: I think G+
will definitely use

815
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,560
structured data in some--

816
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,330
sometimes the same vocabulary,
sometimes different

817
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,340
vocabularies, to preview
the content of

818
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,150
a page that's shared.

819
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:41,980
And otherwise, we're using
structured data now, or

820
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:45,480
planning to use it wherever it
make sense-- we have enough

821
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,480
coverage and we have the right
motivation with the webmaster.

822
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:54,325

823
00:36:54,325 --> 00:36:56,220
AUDIENCE: I help manage a large
commerce site, so we

824
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:00,680
have a dot com and then a mobile
property, as well.

825
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,320
Mobile property is powered
by an API.

826
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:07,480
All the content data is the
same, but it's just a

827
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,260
different back end.

828
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:11,410
So we use structured data
on the big site.

829
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:13,640
On the mobile site, though, we
don't use structured data.

830
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,560
Is that a problem?

831
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,820
Should we be using structured
data for the mobile

832
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,070
property, as well?

833
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:21,650

834
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,250
JUSTIN BOYAN: Good question.

835
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,640
So you mean like a
mobile website?

836
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,220
You're not talking
about an app?

837
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:30,850
AUDIENCE: No, it's actually
m dot ticketmaster.com

838
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:32,100
JUSTIN BOYAN: M dot.

839
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:36,790

840
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:37,270
I don't know.

841
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:39,320
I'm going to answer that one
with an I don't know.

842
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,655
JOSH AIN: I think it depends
on your search strategy.

843
00:37:41,655 --> 00:37:45,720
If you're referring to your
desktop version of your site

844
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,100
as canonical in all instances,
then you don't expect your

845
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,790
mobile site to show
up in search.

846
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:53,660
So for the motivations that we
were showing today, it doesn't

847
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,000
matter if it's on your
mobile site.

848
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,840
If you do expect the mobile
site to be a first order

849
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,490
destination, then it is useful
to have the same structured

850
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,986
markup that you're already
using on your main site.

851
00:38:03,986 --> 00:38:06,470
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

852
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:07,750
AUDIENCE: Similar question.

853
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:11,270
If we already have structured
data in the form of JSON or

854
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:14,970
any sort of external API, is
there a simple way to just

855
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:18,590
link from our product page that
you're crawling to where

856
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:22,260
that structured data
already is?

857
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,300
JUSTIN BOYAN: No.

858
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,860
I don't think so.

859
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,826
You mean, if you have--

860
00:38:27,826 --> 00:38:31,170
so your data is not in the web
page, but it's available on

861
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:32,580
the web in some other format?

862
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,540
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I mean, most
web pages get created from

863
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,950
some sort of structured
data already.

864
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:39,265
So if we already have that--
in fact, we're creating our

865
00:38:39,265 --> 00:38:43,520
web pages from a back end API
already, so why not just give

866
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,047
you a link to that instead
of peppering our

867
00:38:47,047 --> 00:38:48,480
HTML page with it?

868
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,390
JUSTIN BOYAN: There is,
philosophically, to us a

869
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:54,350
benefit to having the markup
right in the user-visible web

870
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:58,140
page, because that's, to us,
the ultimate guarantee that

871
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:01,040
the structured data we're
showing corresponds to the

872
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,740
user-visible version
of that data.

873
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:08,950
And if you point us to the API
directly and explain the

874
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:12,740
mapping somehow that way, maybe
that's right for your

875
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:15,650
site, but in some other site the
two data sources might get

876
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:16,370
out of sync.

877
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:18,760
AUDIENCE: Well, the question
was actually--

878
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,360
I thought of it based on his
mobile question just

879
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:21,860
previously.

880
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,640
There are numerous ways to
consume the same data that

881
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,880
we're providing to our users.

882
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,760
And so creating that structured
data in every

883
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,370
format of consumption, whether
it's mobile or other third

884
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:38,060
party applications or web, it
all points back to that same

885
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,280
structured data in
the first place.

886
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,710
So putting out multiple copies
of all of the structured data

887
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:47,770
seems confusing, potentially,
for Google and others.

888
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:50,660
JUSTIN BOYAN: Well, it's just
some lightweight HTML

889
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,780
annotations on the
presentation.

890
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:55,746
And so if you're presenting in
multiple ways, I don't think

891
00:39:55,746 --> 00:39:59,970
you should necessarily think of
it as a huge burden to put

892
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:02,620
those annotations on each
different presentation.

893
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,940
JOSH AIN: But I also think that
you're going to have a

894
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:07,330
canonical version, or you can
specify a canonical version.

895
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:11,780
And so the canonical version, I
believe, is what we're going

896
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,920
to refer to in search,
not the other

897
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,900
representations of the same page.

898
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,700
So if the structured data is
there in the canonical

899
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,120
version, then we'll
understand it.

900
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,980
I'd also add that, as we saw in
this little crying slide,

901
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,790
we do understand lots of
different formats.

902
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,640
But as Justin said, we prefer
to be on the page so that we

903
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:31,650
can actually associate it with
the user-visible data.

904
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,610
AUDIENCE: Yeah, to seem like
a single canonical

905
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:34,990
version for the web.

906
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:37,060
But then it seems like it would
be even better to have a

907
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:41,640
single canonical version for all
presentations of that same

908
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,130
information.

909
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,550
JUSTIN BOYAN: Let's talk
about this more.

910
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,900
JOSH AIN: Yeah, we'd love
to keep talking.

911
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,160
Looks like we're out of time.

912
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,490
But thank you all.

913
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:55,162
