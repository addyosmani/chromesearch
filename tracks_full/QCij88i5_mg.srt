1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,050
ANNA PATTERSON: Now I want to
introduce Johanna Wright.

3
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:06,780
She's the Lead Product Manager
of Search for many years,

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,380
launching such innovations as
Universal Search, Instant, and

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,250
the Knowledge Graph.

6
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,500
And now she's leading up Search
in Android, including

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,392
Google Now, Voice Search,
and Speech.

8
00:00:19,392 --> 00:00:27,740
[APPLAUSE]

9
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,720
JOHANNA WRIGHT: Let's step
back to January 2003.

10
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,790
At this point in time,
I'm living in my

11
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,500
father in-law's house.

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,760
He's put a nice curtain up for
my section of the living room,

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,380
where my husband and I share
an air mattress.

14
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,740
The sun streams in.

15
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,880
6:00 AM we wake up every
morning because of the

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,610
unbearable Orange County heat.

17
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:53,790
Air mattress is popped,
and I'm unemployed.

18
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,930
Just six months earlier, I was a
young tech exec in New York,

19
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,400
first during the dot-com
boom and then bust.

20
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,760
But my company that I worked at
had finally shut its doors.

21
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,730
And my husband and I decided
to get on our bicycles and

22
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:12,990
ride across the country
to lovely, sunny LA.

23
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,520
Riding across the country
with your new

24
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,820
husband is a lot of fun.

25
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,980
Showing up in LA, a new city,
with no job, not so much fun.

26
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,630

27
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,850
Then the rejection letters from
business schools started

28
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,750
pouring in.

29
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,250
And it's January, and there's
only one business school I

30
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,110
haven't heard back from.

31
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,690
But I'm not feeling too
optimistic because they're

32
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,020
supposed to interview all of
their candidates, and they're

33
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,760
going to mail out their verdict
two days later, and

34
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,260
they still haven't
interviewed me.

35
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,130
But then I got an email from
UCLA that said we want to

36
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,780
interview you.

37
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:51,160
And since my confidence had been
shot, my response was,

38
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:56,800
"You do?" I was fortunate enough
to get to go to UCLA

39
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,380
for business school, and then
I got a job at Google.

40
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,130
And today I'm going to talk
about my career starting out

41
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,420
at Google and what it was like
to be a Product Manager at

42
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,280
Google and give some bits
of advice about product

43
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,850
management.

44
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,110
But my first piece of career
advice is that your career is

45
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,640
not going to be linear.

46
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,010
Expect to be disrupted.

47
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:21,600
This is a disruptive industry,
and you, too, may someday be

48
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,340
unemployed on your
father-in-law's couch.

49
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,140
What's really going to matter is
the energy and the tenacity

50
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,500
with which you pick yourself
up and take

51
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,430
on your next adventure.

52
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,970
OK, so let's jump into Google.

53
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,660
I was hired to be a Product
Manager working in Search.

54
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,840
My boss gave me two
options of jobs.

55
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,260
One was something called
Universal Search.

56
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,310
Universal Search was the project
where we took all the

57
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,000
content from our different
back ends--

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,580
maps, videos, images--

59
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,340
and we put them in the main
search results pane.

60
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,310
The other option that she gave
me was to do something called

61
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,770
Premium Content Search.

62
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,630
This is where we searched all
the content behind pay walls

63
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,300
and put it in the
search results.

64
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,710
Both these things seemed pretty
interesting, and I was

65
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,010
so new to Google, I didn't have
any context or judgment

66
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,830
to make a decision.

67
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,030
Fortunately for me, I had gone
to the same business school as

68
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,450
Susan Wojcicki, my fellow
panelist, and so I asked her

69
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,810
for some advice.

70
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,630
Susan looked at me like
I had two heads.

71
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,040
What?

72
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,960
Of course you should do
Universal Search.

73
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,370
That's our business, Johanna.

74
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,430
So this leads to another
piece of career wisdom.

75
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,590
What does a good opportunity
look like?

76
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,560
Well, a good opportunity
looks like

77
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,980
something that's strategic.

78
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,310
If you're doing something
that's in line with the

79
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,785
company's mission and it has
not been done before, well,

80
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:42,590
then it's very likely to
be a good opportunity.

81
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,900
OK, so let me jump into
Universal Search.

82
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,530

83
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,070
This was 2005 at Google.

84
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,490
Google was growing like crazy.

85
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,180
It was very chaotic.

86
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,580
And it's kind of
hard to know--

87
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,790
for me it was hard to know how
projects got assigned, what

88
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:59,910
you're working on.

89
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,480
And I got paired up with an
infrastructure team while I

90
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,550
was working on Universal
Search.

91
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,200
This was a great team, but a
team that was very focused on

92
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,110
building infrastructure,
and they didn't want

93
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,590
to build any features.

94
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,750
And I was a Product Manager, and
I was being judged on the

95
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,740
features that I launched.

96
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,480
And so it was pretty stressful,
because I wasn't

97
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,339
delivering anything.

98
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:22,240
And so what I ended up doing was
creating a set of mocks, a

99
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,130
series of mocks of what
Universal Search could look

100
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,880
like, and then I created a
little PowerPoint deck, and I

101
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,900
walked around Google, and I
introduced myself to anyone

102
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,720
who looked like they might want
to be a Features Tech

103
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,890
Lead to see if they wanted
to join my project.

104
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,950
And I was fortunate enough to
meet a person named David

105
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:41,860
Bailey, who wanted to join on
and lead the features side of

106
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,220
the effort.

107
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,720
And then the project really
started to get legs.

108
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,290
So here's the beginning of my
product management specific

109
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,180
advice, and that is
to paint a vision.

110
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,920
Once you paint a vision and you
share your vision, people

111
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,410
will follow.

112
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,310
It'll be a lot easier to follow
once you have a vision.

113
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,670
OK, so David and I started.

114
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,900
There was a big mountain
in front of us.

115
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,030
We didn't really know
what to do.

116
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,050
This project had failed a
number of times before.

117
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,080
We didn't really know
why it had failed.

118
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,040
And I had this idea that we
should do a user study.

119
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,150
Just trying to figure out what
to do, we said, well, let's

120
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,720
just do a user study.

121
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,170
So we pulled together
a prototype

122
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,710
to do our user study.

123
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,900
And once we had this prototype,
the people around

124
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,620
us in Google started to be
able to imagine that this

125
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,860
product might come to life and
that something might happen.

126
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,510
And so this brings me to my
second piece of product

127
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:37,150
management advice, which is that
if you don't really know

128
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,900
what to do, you should
just do something.

129
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,540
Do something to move
the ball forward.

130
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,640

131
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,440
I was very fortunate, though,
that a user study was what we

132
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,750
decided to do, because
people loved it.

133
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,670
And it was so awesome.

134
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,590
We learned that the project
and the product had legs.

135
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,320
So I remember sitting in the
labs, and it was in the spring

136
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,690
of 2006, for our user study.

137
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:03,920
And one of the searches
we asked people to

138
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,530
do was Barry Bonds.

139
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:08,340
Now, this was a long time ago.

140
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,210
This was the Dark Ages.

141
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,090
YouTube was just starting out.

142
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,660
But there was a home video that
someone had uploaded of

143
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,210
Barry Bonds tying Babe Ruth's
home run record.

144
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,310
And the participant in our
study, she clicked on the

145
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:26,060
video, she watched the ball sail
out into the field, and

146
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,140
she had this big smile
on her face.

147
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,830
It wasn't unnatural at all that
she saw this video in the

148
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,540
search results.

149
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,910
So we knew the project
had legs, and it was

150
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,870
just a great moment.

151
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:43,070
So my final and most important
piece of product management

152
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,580
advice is to listen
to your users.

153
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:49,120
And even more importantly, use
your products yourself.

154
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,170
Just this weekend when I was
using Android Search, I

155
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:55,820
noticed that speech recognition
is slow, like

156
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,490
maybe one in seven times.

157
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,750
I don't know why, but I'm
really glad that we're

158
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,582
investing in speed.

159
00:07:01,582 --> 00:07:04,250
Then I also had some magical
experiences with Google Now.

160
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,590
So I was invited to go to a
birthday party in Burlingame,

161
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,890
and Google Now reminded
me about the party.

162
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,040
And it even told me that
Burlingame was 30 minutes from

163
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,180
my house, which I didn't know,
and it was super helpful.

164
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,270
The more you use your products,
the easier it is to

165
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,290
make decisions and to have an
intuitive feel for what you

166
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,540
should be doing.

167
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,820

168
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,360
So let's summarize my product
management advice.

169
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,858
One, paint a vision.

170
00:07:29,858 --> 00:07:32,510
Two, when you don't know what
to do, just make mini

171
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,240
milestones.

172
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,380
Roll that ball forward.

173
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,930
And three, use your products.

174
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,240

175
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,120
Since this is a Women's
Techmakers event, I thought

176
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,450
I'd close with my very
own lean-in story.

177
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,740

178
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,950
So back when all this Universal
Search stuff was

179
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,880
going on, I ended up
getting pregnant.

180
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,700
And when I was eight months
pregnant, my boss, Marissa

181
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:00,020
Mayer, suggested that I lead a
team of senior engineers to

182
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,060
come up with the search strategy
for the next year.

183
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,680
Now, the search strategy, the
process, the normal process,

184
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,690
was to set this meeting in
mid-November, but my baby was

185
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,000
supposed to be born at
the end of October.

186
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,620
And they're like, hey, no
problem, we'll just

187
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,480
move the date up.

188
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:22,840
Didn't give me very much time
to prepare, and my baby was

189
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,670
something that you
call transverse.

190
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:27,130
So he's lying on his side, and
I had to have a C-section.

191
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,666
So they moved the date up.

192
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,360
I moved my C-section to the
very last possible date.

193
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,960
We met in the middle.

194
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,800
And on Wednesday, I gave the
strategy presentation.

195
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,195
On Thursday, I had my baby.

196
00:08:38,195 --> 00:08:42,159

197
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,720
Now, this might be horrifying
to some of you, but to me it

198
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,850
was invigorating.

199
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,280
And it set me up to have a
leadership role in Search when

200
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,670
I returned from my leave.

201
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,590
And the point I want you to take
away is not that you need

202
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,900
to sacrifice your family
for your career.

203
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,510
I feel fortunate enough that
I haven't had to do that.

204
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,080
You see, there was no question
in my mind that given that

205
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,290
opportunity, I would want to
give that presentation.

206
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:09,990
And it was really huge that
my manager believed in me.

207
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,340
So the takeaway that I'd like
us to take is that as

208
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:16,010
managers, we shouldn't assume
people's abilities or desires.

209
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,500
We should ask.

210
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,120
As managers, it's our job to
enable greatness in our teams.

211
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,820

212
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:32,278
[APPLAUSE]
