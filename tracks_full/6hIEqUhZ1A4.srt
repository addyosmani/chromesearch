00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,430

2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,280
LOUIS GRAY: Welcome back to
Google Developers Live at I/O

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,610
from Moscone Center here
in San Francisco.

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,260
We're here to talk
about Blink.

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,090
I'm Louis Gray, and
I'm joined by Alex

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,120
Komoroske and Paul Irish.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,830
Welcome, gentlemen.

8
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,140
Thanks for joining us.

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:22,565
PAUL IRISH: Absolutely.

10
00:00:22,565 --> 00:00:22,990
ALEX KOMOROSKE: No problem.

11
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,245
LOUIS GRAY: Real quickly, we
want to talk about Blink, a

12
00:00:25,245 --> 00:00:26,730
brand new rendering engine.

13
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,830
I want to get you guys' take
on what's been introduced.

14
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,790
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So Blink is
a new rendering engine.

15
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,930
It's based originally
off WebKit.

16
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,170
It's a rendering engine that's
open source, and it's using

17
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,820
Chromium and Chrome.

18
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,090
LOUIS GRAY: So you
said open source.

19
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,310
Is it a Google product?

20
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,250
Open source?

21
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,460
Help us out.

22
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,340
PAUL IRISH: I mean, it's
operated within kind of the

23
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,110
Chromium open-source
community.

24
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,510
So there's Chromium, which is
kind of the open-source

25
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,480
implementation of
Google Chrome.

26
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,840
And they're basically 99% the
same, with a few very small

27
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,175
differences.

28
00:01:00,175 --> 00:01:07,880
But Blink is an open-source
project, and we expect it to

29
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,315
be used in Opera's
products as well.

30
00:01:10,315 --> 00:01:10,650
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Yeah.

31
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,010
So it's open source, and one
of our main goals for the

32
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:14,980
project is to be as

33
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,850
transparent, as open as possible.

34
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,050
So we're trying to
have as much of a

35
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,090
discussion in public channels.

36
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,270
We've already seen a lot of
really good engagement from

37
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,900
people from other companies,
from other organizations, and

38
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,740
web developers on these threads,
sort of providing

39
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,510
their feedback about features
we're thinking about

40
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,280
implementing.

41
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,630
It's been really great.

42
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:31,945
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

43
00:01:31,945 --> 00:01:33,050
So how does a new
rendering engine

44
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:34,490
benefit consumers anyway?

45
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,140
Is it going to get faster?

46
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:36,810
What's going to happen?

47
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,135
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So as
it starts out, it's

48
00:01:38,135 --> 00:01:39,080
based off of WebKit.

49
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,630
So basically, as of a
month ago, it was

50
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:42,870
almost exactly the same.

51
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,100
Since then, we've been
optimizing some pieces on our

52
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,350
side, and it will continue
to get faster.

53
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,670
And over time, however, a
stronger, faster rendering

54
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,630
engine allows you to
do new things.

55
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,350
So it allows developers to
build better experiences.

56
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,850
It allows them to be faster so
consumers' webpages will just

57
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,290
appear faster and
do more things.

58
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,080
PAUL IRISH: One of the main
things that we focus a lot on

59
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,670
is speed, right?

60
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,889
And so when I'm scrolling a page
on my phone, I want it to

61
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:11,140
stick my finger,
and I want that

62
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,150
experience to be fantastic.

63
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,310
And with Blink, we have the
opportunity to make some

64
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:19,080
really radical changes to the
infrastructure of how a

65
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,870
browser's put together to really
deliver a fast and

66
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,330
awesome user experience.

67
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,390
LOUIS GRAY: One thing that's
really interesting.

68
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,240
You look at the web-- and it
was talked about today in

69
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,850
today's keynote--

70
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,470
we're on the 20th anniversary
of the

71
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,740
introduction of the web.

72
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,330
And one of the things that's
really helped the web grow and

73
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,720
just work on practically every
device is standards.

74
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,980
And so with an introduction of
a new rendering engine, is

75
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,700
this situation where web
developers and app developers

76
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,810
who code for the web are going
to have to make two versions

77
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:45,990
of their product?

78
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,450
What does that mean for
a developer's side?

79
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,530
PAUL IRISH: There's no
big real changes.

80
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,410
Blink is dedicated to
just supporting an

81
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,530
interoperable web.

82
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,400
And that's something that we
believe a lot, and it's having

83
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,480
a compatible, interoperable
web.

84
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,470
So for developers building
for the web, you

85
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,490
build to web standards.

86
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,430
You build just as you did, and
you can expect it to work.

87
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,220
ALEX KOMOROSKE: And I think
back many, many years ago,

88
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,940
different browsers were
very different.

89
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,040
I think in the past few years,
the different rendering

90
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,840
engines have gotten
closer and closer.

91
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,370
PAUL IRISH: A lot closer.

92
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,410
ALEX KOMOROSKE: A lot closer as
everyone really is taking

93
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,910
standards very seriously.

94
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,710
We're also very excited to
invest more in testing, so

95
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,590
helping write tests with
standards organizations and

96
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,170
other browser vendors
that all the browser

97
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,245
rendering engines can run.

98
00:03:33,245 --> 00:03:35,310
And that helps verify that
these things are

99
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,130
interoperable.

100
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,780
And so the developers don't
have to write totally

101
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,100
different versions for
different browsers.

102
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,740
PAUL IRISH: In the past,
developers have known about

103
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,895
browser quirks and
things like that.

104
00:03:43,895 --> 00:03:46,240
And over the past two years,
there have been less and less,

105
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,810
because browsers are running
the exact same tests, even

106
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,010
though they're different
products.

107
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:50,130
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

108
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,150
So this is the situation.

109
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,930
You used to have
modern browsers

110
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,590
and non-modern browsers.

111
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,020
Is Blink a cut above?

112
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,110
Is it going to be the
most modern browser?

113
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,320
PAUL IRISH: It certainly moves
fast, and it gets new features

114
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,670
all the time.

115
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:06,120
But you're going to get a
consistent experience when

116
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,520
you're coding to the
new features.

117
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,920
ALEX KOMOROSKE: The goal is
to build the best possible

118
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,840
rendering engine we can.

119
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,390
But what's great about the open
web is you have all these

120
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,620
different compatible rendering
engines, and so this is very

121
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,540
healthy competition
to spur innovation

122
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,120
throughout the ecosystem.

123
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,814
LOUIS GRAY: One thing we
talked about before.

124
00:04:21,814 --> 00:04:25,050
Since Blink is still fairly
new, and we're talking a

125
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,380
little bit about the new
features that are

126
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,105
going to come out.

127
00:04:27,105 --> 00:04:29,740
We expect the community to
respond really strongly.

128
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,580
One of the questions I have
around browsing is we have so

129
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,660
many people who are browsing on
mobile these days, relative

130
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,700
to the desktop.

131
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,610
How much did the advancement
of mobile usage of browsing

132
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,310
impact the decision to
look toward Blink?

133
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,150
And do you think that mobile
users can see the benefits of

134
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,780
Blink as quickly as desktop?

135
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,520
ALEX KOMOROSKE: If you saw the
keynote this morning, Linus

136
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,970
talked a lot about how the
future of the web is mobile,

137
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,730
and so we take this really
serious on the Chrome team.

138
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,880
Now, the reason that we started
Blink actually came

139
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,080
down to the fact that Chromium's
multiprocess

140
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,800
architecture is just different
than the other WebKit-based

141
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,105
browsers, and it led to
complexity in the code base.

142
00:05:04,105 --> 00:05:06,860
And that was primarily the thing
that drove us to make

143
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,370
this decision.

144
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,595
But yes, we care very deeply
about mobile, and we're

145
00:05:09,595 --> 00:05:11,060
excited about the different
kinds of things we can

146
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,750
experiment with.

147
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,500
LOUIS GRAY: And when
you look at the

148
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,730
complexity in the code base--

149
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,490
I remember when we launched,
and we had our initial blog

150
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,200
posts and the reactions
to it--

151
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,860
a lot of discussion was taken
to kind of getting away some

152
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,070
of the cruft or older code that
was available in WebKit.

153
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,520
How does that benefit
folks as well?

154
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,380
Is it just easier to
develop on it with

155
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,250
fewer lines of code?

156
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,290
I mean, what are we
getting away from?

157
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,092
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I want to point
out, actually, that

158
00:05:29,092 --> 00:05:30,920
WebKit is an amazing
code base, and

159
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,540
it's an amazing community.

160
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,690
And what we were trying to
remove were pieces that just

161
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,110
weren't relevant to Chromium.

162
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,760
And so when you have extra stuff
in a code base that you

163
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,610
aren't using, that's
code that has more

164
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,730
surface area for bugs.

165
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,265
It takes longer to check
out as a developer.

166
00:05:43,265 --> 00:05:45,830
It takes longer to
buil build even.

167
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,850
And so it was removing pieces
that didn't apply to Chromium

168
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,560
but were still very nice
pieces of code, like

169
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,740
JavaScriptCore, for example.

170
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,240
LOUIS GRAY: And you've mentioned
code and cruft.

171
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,570
One of the fun things I've seen
bump up in coverage of

172
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,890
Blink is vendor prefixes.

173
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,820
For those of us online who
don't know what a vendor

174
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,490
prefix is, what is it, Paul?

175
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,180
And why do I care about
a vendor prefix?

176
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,390
PAUL IRISH: Sure.

177
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,020
The idea behind vendor
prefix is a way to

178
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,680
kind of insulate users.

179
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,660
When browsers want to introduce
kind of a new,

180
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,600
experimental feature and they
want to be able to have a

181
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,810
little bit of freedom to maybe
change it in the future.

182
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,460
And then, browser vendors will
kind of work together,

183
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,100
standardize it.

184
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,825
And then, the prefix that's in
front of it will disappear.

185
00:06:23,825 --> 00:06:25,470
It will graduate.

186
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,100
Now, that was kind of
the idea behind it,

187
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,275
and that sounds good.

188
00:06:28,275 --> 00:06:31,020
But in practice over the past
few years, it's kind of not

189
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,110
worked out, and it's had
some kind of harmful

190
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,740
effects on the ecosystem.

191
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,980
So one of the things with the
introduction of Blink was that

192
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,290
we were able to take a policy
and said that we're not going

193
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,220
to be introducing any
new vendor prefixes.

194
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,840
It's painful as a developer to
deal with having multiple

195
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,090
vendor prefixes, and we're not
going to add any new ones, and

196
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:52,760
we're not going to introduce new
features that have this.

197
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,080
And this is a similar model to
what Mozilla with Firefox has

198
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,640
gone towards.

199
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,205
And also, the W3C CSS Working
Group has kind of said that

200
00:07:00,205 --> 00:07:03,341
this is the direction that makes
sense going forward.

201
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:05,630
LOUIS GRAY: Now, Blink
is still fairly new.

202
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,590
I know a lot of people, often
when something comes out,

203
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,790
right away they say, how can
I get my hands on it?

204
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:13,340
And because Blink is an engine
and not an app, it's not like

205
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,630
you can just download Blink
and start playing.

206
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,520
So if you want to get your
hands on it, either as a

207
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,200
developer or as a user, what's
the best way to do that?

208
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,770
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So again, from
the very beginning, it was

209
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,050
literally just WebKit.

210
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,650
And then, we've been developing
in a slightly

211
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,710
different direction.

212
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,820
And so all the newest versions
ever since April 4th, I think,

213
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,360
when we announced Blink, have
been using "Blink."

214
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,420
It's just that it's not really
that different yet.

215
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,050
It's getting more and
more different.

216
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,360
And so those versions will
become on the stable channel

217
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,793
of Chrome in a number
of weeks.

218
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:43,220
PAUL IRISH: The Chrome Beta has
Blink in it, and Canary

219
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:43,735
has Blink in it.

220
00:07:43,735 --> 00:07:46,540
So if you want to try
it out, but--

221
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,440
ALEX KOMOROSKE: It's not going
to feel very different.

222
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,430
PAUL IRISH: No.

223
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,590
LOUIS GRAY: And as a Chrome OS
user, do I get access to Blink

224
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,220
as well, or is that
a separate branch?

225
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:52,545
PAUL IRISH: Yup.

226
00:07:52,545 --> 00:07:52,870
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Absolutely.

227
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,690
LOUIS GRAY: So I'm using
my Pixel here.

228
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:57,750
I use Pixel practically every
single day, as often as I can.

229
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,420
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I love mine.

230
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,020
LOUIS GRAY: And so one of the
things that's been really cool

231
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,760
for me for the Pixel--

232
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,660
I know we have a conversation
about that tomorrow--

233
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,420
is you're finding more and more
web apps are replacing

234
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,110
the things that I traditionally
had to use a

235
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,320
desktop for.

236
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,795
Is that part of also our
consideration, as we build a

237
00:08:12,795 --> 00:08:15,420
new rendering engine, to enable
what's next in the

238
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:15,810
world of web apps?

239
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:16,390
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Absolutely.

240
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,860
We believe very firmly that the
web platform deserves to

241
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,080
be as powerful as any other
native platform.

242
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,680
And so we've been pushing within
the ecosystem, within

243
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,575
the standards bodies, and really
supporting that drive

244
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:32,512
to make the web platform as
powerful as possible.

245
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:32,924
LOUIS GRAY: That's awesome.

246
00:08:32,924 --> 00:08:35,260
Well, Paul and Alex, I
appreciate you guys coming

247
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:35,549
down today.

248
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:38,590
I know you have a very busy
Google I/O. Really one of the

249
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,559
hottest topics that's out there
for the web and for

250
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,720
Google in general.

251
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,669
For those you on the livestream,
stay tuned.

252
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:45,990
We have four more sessions
coming your way, whether

253
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,960
you're on the Android Channel,
Chrome Channel, or the

254
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,940
technical ones as well.

255
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,230
And we'll be back right after
those with more programming at

256
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,800
Google Developers Live at I/O.

257
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,818
