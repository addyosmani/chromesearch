1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,460

2
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,470
SUSAN WOJCICKI: And now I'd like
to invite Anna Patterson

3
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,960
to come up on stage.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,940
Anna Patterson has worked on
some of the biggest, most

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,020
ambitious projects I've seen at
Google, and she's going to

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,000
tell you a little
bit about them.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,260
Anna is Vice President of
Engineering and Artificial

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,200
Intelligence.

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,400
What an amazing role
and opportunity.

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,006
So let's please welcome
Anna onto the stage.

11
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:27,500
Thank you.

12
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,476
[APPLAUSE]

13
00:00:29,476 --> 00:00:35,900

14
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:41,080
ANNA PATTERSON: So I'm here to
tell a little bit of hacker

15
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:46,310
stories from the trench, and I
think with a main theme of

16
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,530
perseverance.

17
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,330
I saw that the ENIAC
programmers, how they got a

18
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,590
circuit diagram in
order to program.

19
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,640
My first programming job out of
school was for the F-15E,

20
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,330
and we would test our software
the best you can on something

21
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,100
that wasn't flying.

22
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,540
And then we'd invariably
need to put in patches.

23
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,940
And just like the ENIAC, you had
to toggle in the program.

24
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,240
So it was very scary since
people's lives were

25
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,400
depending on it.

26
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,300
But also I was thinking
about how

27
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,550
source control has evolved.

28
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:29,270

29
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,300
Of course, my first programs
in high school

30
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,600
were on punch cards.

31
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,740
But at home, I was really
fortunate that my dad brought

32
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,650
home a Commodore Pet computer,
and he encouraged us to

33
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,990
experiment and write
a program on it.

34
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:47,100
And I wrote a really, really
horrible, terrible video game,

35
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,670
and it only had 8K of memory.

36
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,770
So I stored the program state
in the corners so they were

37
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,020
flashing weirdly.

38
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,150

39
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,460
And, you know, I guess it was a
standard trick, I found out

40
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,630
much later.

41
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,290
But I was from the suburbs of
Saint Louis, so I wasn't

42
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:09,430
really part of a burgeoning
hacker community.

43
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,410
I eventually got my PhD in
computer science at the

44
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,860
University of Illinois,
Champaign.

45
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,590
And then I became a research
faculty member for John

46
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,140
McCarthy, the founder of AI.

47
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:25,740
And I see several people here
who know me really well, and

48
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,340
so you'll appreciate when I say
that John McCarthy made me

49
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,820
do something how hard
that must have been.

50
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,140
So he made me look into this
area called phenomenal data

51
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:40,250
mining, where you're given
facts and relations, and

52
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,220
you're given a big data set.

53
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,050
Big was very small
in those days.

54
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:49,110
And then when you learn new
correlations, you can explain

55
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,170
these new correlations in
terms of underlying

56
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,460
phenomenon.

57
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,040
So that's where it got its name
and that technique is

58
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,420
still in use.

59
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,580
But everybody was leaving the
department to start companies,

60
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,550
so we were pretty much like
the last ones out when the

61
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,160
lights were turning off.

62
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:11,570
And I co-founded, in 1998,
a web mining company.

63
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:15,300
Because the web was so big at
5 million pages, we thought,

64
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,000
how are people going to be able
to get around this thing?

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,300
And so we had an idea to make a
automatic taxonomy and kind

66
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,540
of lead people to what questions
were answerable on

67
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,520
the web and what ones weren't.

68
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,910
Because in those days, trust
me, there weren't really

69
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,360
recipes on the web,
but the taxonomy

70
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,770
around Linux was deep.

71
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:41,160
So we got angel funded to do
this just in time for the

72
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,960
dot-com crash.

73
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,720
And so I tried to figure out
what my other passion was, and

74
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,050
I said, mobile is just
about to take off.

75
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:56,410
So I moved into the mobile area
in 1999, just in time for

76
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,320
the telco crash.

77
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,680
So after killing two industries,
I was actually--

78
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,170
I had a one-year-old, and I
was four months pregnant.

79
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,990
And of course, I was unemployed
and I was actually

80
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:12,670
living in Pavni's guest room,
who's in the front row.

81
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:16,019
And so the doctor said,
you know, you need

82
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,089
to be on bed rest.

83
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:19,560
And I said, have you ever
heard of programming?

84
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,079
And he hadn't.

85
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,870
And I said, it's a lot
like bed rest.

86
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,160

87
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,890
So I volunteered at the Internet
Archive, and they

88
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,790
have snapshots of the
web over time.

89
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,340
So as such, especially
in 2001, it was much

90
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,100
bigger than the web.

91
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,800
It had 30 billion web pages, and
the live web at the time

92
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,510
maybe had 5 billion.

93
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:46,270
So I did a history-based search
engine that launched at

94
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:50,900
like, 12 billion pages, and you
could look at how terms

95
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,300
change over time.

96
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,880
So you could dial back to 1997
and search for a term like

97
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,530
"Clinton," and you'd see all
these co-occurring terms in a

98
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,700
graph and how they changed over
time, and it was very

99
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,120
presidential.

100
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,030
Dialing it up to 1999, it wasn't
quite as presidential.

101
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:12,120
And then moving forward to
today, everything is about

102
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,000
Hillary Clinton, if you search
for Clinton, when you look at

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,120
the popularity of the
things on the web.

104
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,680
So it was a really interesting
project, and I was doing it as

105
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,100
a volunteer.

106
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,060
And four days after it launched,
various companies

107
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,570
wanted to talk about
acquiring it.

108
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:31,860
So I go from volunteer,
stay-at-home mom, to the world

109
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,010
of corp dev.

110
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,900
So that was really fun.

111
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,650
So that's how I wound
up at Google.

112
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:42,620
And at Google, I really wanted
to unlock some global and

113
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,000
local information.

114
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,650
One of our examples was about
these small towns in Germany

115
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:52,520
with their local Oktoberfests
and how that information was

116
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,970
really important to them.

117
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,560
And we weren't quite
big enough to get

118
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,160
everything to everyone.

119
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,510
And so at Google, we evolve our
system so just when one

120
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,440
system launches, we would
start a new one.

121
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,700
So when one such system just
launched, I came up with the

122
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,090
idea for TeraGoogle.

123
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:16,330
And speaking of thinking big,
probably 95% of people said,

124
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,120
why would we ever need
a search system

125
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,320
for a trillion pages?

126
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,300
And of course, the founders
were like, is that all?

127
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,580
So at the time, it was
very cost efficient.

128
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,970
When it launched, it was about
50 times cheaper than our main

129
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,520
line index.

130
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,450
And at the same time, some of my
web ranking team went off,

131
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,880
and they shipped one of our
early deep-learning projects,

132
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,690
which was around ads broadening,
like once you bit

133
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:46,180
on one keyword, what other
keywords do you--

134
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,210
might be interesting.

135
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,700
So after having my fourth child,
I did what everybody

136
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,790
does when they have four
kids, and they're

137
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,390
on maternity leave.

138
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,640
I decided to start a company.

139
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,070

140
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,810
So I started a company--

141
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,760
Cuil.

142
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:05,440
And we really wanted to bring
like a really high-res, rich

143
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,560
experience to people with high
bandwidth, and a really low

144
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,420
bandwidth experience to people
who had feature phones.

145
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:17,480
And so what we did around the
low bandwidth experience is we

146
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,430
summarized things so that a fact
that appeared on tons of

147
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:26,310
web pages was on top in kind
of paragraph format with a

148
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:30,690
bunch of references down to much
rarer facts that had much

149
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,690
fewer references.

150
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:35,280
So after Cuil, I returned to
Google where I became one of

151
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,330
the first 100 engineers in
Android, because this time, I

152
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,020
was pretty sure the
mobile revolution

153
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,920
was going to happen.

154
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,020
But it wasn't a sure thing.

155
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:50,010
I mean, at that time, Android
had sold 40 million phones.

156
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:53,090
And of course, today it was
announced that Android now has

157
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,700
900 million.

158
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,720
I was part of the team that
helped launch Google Play on

159
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,140
Play tablets.

160
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:05,170
And very recently, like two
weeks ago, we shipped a native

161
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:08,790
search architecture onto the
phone to index all the local

162
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:12,320
data so that when you're
offline, you can have access

163
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,190
to it, and some data never
leaves your phone.

164
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:18,420
So a lot of people say, wait,
Google's so good at search.

165
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,040
Why didn't you just compile
the thing and

166
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,450
put it on the phone?

167
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,100
Well, the phone is kind of like
my early Commodore Pet

168
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,070
computer, not quite as bad,
but compared to a

169
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,960
data center, it is.

170
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,520
And each of the programs can
only have 20 meg resident in

171
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,900
memory and the executable is 500
meg as hard constraints.

172
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,169
So trust me when I say that
Google search system, its

173
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:46,500
executable is bigger
than 500 meg.

174
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,270
So when we look at this system,
because of the success

175
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,630
of Android as a compute cluster,
it's actually over

176
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:57,660
500 exahertz of computing
power, which is way more

177
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,330
powerful than the human brain.

178
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:05,360
So last autumn, I moved over
to our new AI area, where

179
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,550
recently Ray Kurzweil
joined us.

180
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:11,120
And he says that the AIs that
humans create are going to

181
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,840
leave the Earth at light speed
and populate the universe.

182
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,530
So we're not just working on the
most important project on

183
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:22,610
planet Earth, but
in the universe.

184
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:26,400
So I do want to encourage the
Techmakers out there, women

185
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,100
and men, to really reach for the
stars and use technology

186
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,320
to help shape the world.

187
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,040
Technology is a very powerful
platform in order to help

188
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,710
people and enable change.

189
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,520
Thank you.

190
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,770

191
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:46,837
