SETH LADD: Hi, my name
is Seth Ladd.

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,940
I'm a developer advocate
with the Dart project.

4
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,620
In this video, I will introduce
you to the different

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,790
parts of Dart and explain how
Dart can help developers be

6
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,820
more productive, building
faster apps

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,710
for the modern web.

8
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,880
Dart can be a productive
environment for developers new

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,480
to the web, especially
developers familiar and

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,930
comfortable with structured
languages and tools.

11
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,840
You can use Dart to scale from
small scripts to large apps

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,820
that take advantage of the wide
array of HTML5 features.

13
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,230
Dart apps compile to JavaScript
and run across

14
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,660
modern desktop and
mobile browsers.

15
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,890
The Dart language is designed
to be easy to learn for

16
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,970
developers that are familiar
with C#, Java, ActionScript,

17
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,390
and JavaScript.

18
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,890
It is a class-based,
object-oriented, dynamic

19
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,830
language with closures, lexical
scope, and more.

20
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,190
As you can see, the code syntax
looks familiar and is

21
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,700
easy to learn.

22
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,290
Dig a little deeper, and you'll
find some cool features

23
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,570
like optional static type
annotations for inline

24
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,350
documentation, safer concurrent
programming with

25
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,750
isolates, libraries for code
organization, and more.

26
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,120
The language is easy to use
with your favorite text

27
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,700
editor, or with our lightweight
and productive

28
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,190
Dart Editor.

29
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,140
Dart Editor can help you create
a project, explore

30
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,480
unfamiliar APIs with code
completion, update the code

31
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,200
with refactoring and quick
fixes, find problems early

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,470
with inline warnings and
errors, and much more.

33
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,800
You also have the option of
using Eclipse and IntelliJ, as

34
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,230
both products support a rich
Dart editing experience.

35
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,970
Once you've written some
Dart code, you can

36
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,450
run it in two ways.

37
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,090
You can run your app across
modern desktop and mobile

38
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,590
browsers, thanks to our
third-generation Dart to

39
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,010
JavaScript compiler.

40
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,850
For faster app downloads, Dart
to JS eliminates dead code

41
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,700
from the generated JavaScript.

42
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,850
Dart to JS also generates
source maps, which tells

43
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,280
browsers how to debug the
original Dart code, even when

44
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,250
it's first compiled
to JavaScript.

45
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,080
For even faster performance,
quicker startup, and a

46
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,910
productive debugging experience,
Dart programs can

47
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,480
also run natively in the
Dart Virtual Machine.

48
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,840
This new VM was originally
designed by the same team that

49
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,190
built V8, Chrome's fast
JavaScript engine.

50
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,300
The Dart VM is built
for speed.

51
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,550
For example, VM snapshots
improve application startup by

52
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,590
up to 10 times.

53
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,240
The VM can power command-line
Dart scripts that access

54
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,600
sockets, files, processes,
and more.

55
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,000
You can even build your own web
server with the Dart VM.

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,250
But with the VM embedded into
web browsers, developers can

57
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,480
quickly test their apps without
first compiling to

58
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,750
JavaScript.

59
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,250
You can debug your apps directly
from Dart Editor by

60
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,570
launching into Dartium,
our custom build of

61
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,410
Chromium with a Dart VM.

62
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,710
Using Dart Editor with Dartium,
you can launch the

63
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:53,310
app, set breakpoints, inspect
variables and objects, and

64
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,600
step through the code.

65
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,655
Developers experience a fast
edit/reload cycle, thanks to

66
00:02:59,655 --> 00:03:02,510
the editor's integration
with Dartium.

67
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,300
Building new apps with the
editor and Dartium is fun.

68
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,800
But developers often need to
integrate with existing

69
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,350
libraries and code.

70
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:12,510
Now there's a way to call
existing JavaScript libraries

71
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,190
directly from Dart.

72
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,330
You can use JavaScript APIs like
Google Maps, or your own

73
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,730
in-house code, without first
porting it to Dart.

74
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,440
But perhaps there's already
a port of your

75
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,390
favorite library to Dart.

76
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,890
To discover, install, and
manage third-party Dart

77
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,940
libraries, use Pub, our
package manager.

78
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,880
A simple configuration file
declares your application's

79
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,260
dependencies, and with a quick
command, those libraries are

80
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,930
downloaded and installed
for your app.

81
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,790
Pub makes it easy to share your
code, install libraries

82
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,780
from other developers,
and keep your

83
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,810
dependencies up to date.

84
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,610
As you can see, Dart is much
more than just a language.

85
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,270
To try it out, you can join
our open-source project,

86
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,310
download Dart Editor, and
learn more about Dart at

87
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,490
dartlang.org.

88
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,740
We look forward to
your feedback.

89
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,655
