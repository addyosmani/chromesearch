00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,450

2
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,620
KATHERINE MILLER:
Hi, everyone.

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,650
And welcome to today's Google
Developers Live session on the

4
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,920
Udacity HTML5 Game Development
Course.

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,020
My name is Katherine Miller.

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,170
I'm a member of the Developer
Marketing Team here at Google.

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,920
And I'll be your moderator
today.

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,970
And I'm very excited to be
joined by four incredible

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,800
guests who are going to be
talking about this program.

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,070
We have Sean Bennett, Course
Architect from Udacity.

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,560
Sebastian Thrun, who is the CEO
of Udacity, as well as a

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,880
Google Fellow.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,420
We have Peter Lubbers, who is
a program manager for Chrome

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,530
Developer Relations.

15
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,600
And Colt McAnlis, who is a
developer advocate for Chrome.

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,900
Little bit of background
on this course.

17
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,280
It launched about nine days
ago and already has over

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,960
46,000 people enrolled.

19
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,140
And to give you a little bit of
context, that's about three

20
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,030
times the size of the current
Stanford student body.

21
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,620
So over the course of nine days,
three times the size of

22
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,280
Stanford has enrolled and
started taking a course which

23
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,400
is pretty incredible.

24
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,710
So I'm really excited to be here
today to share with you

25
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,260
and have them share with you
a little bit about how this

26
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,560
course came to be, as well as
the power of massively open

27
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,000
online courses.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,230
And so to get started, I'm going
to turn to my left and

29
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,485
have Sean and Sebastian
introduce themselves.

30
00:01:32,485 --> 00:01:34,050
And then we'll move
over to the right.

31
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,300
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Sean,
you start.

32
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,850
SEAN BENNETT: I'm
Sean Bennett.

33
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:41,450
I started at Udacity almost
a year ago now, I think.

34
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,930
I've been working on this course
with Colt and Peter and

35
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,040
Calvin Hu, who isn't here today
but is probably the

36
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,520
single person most responsible
for getting it out.

37
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,894
[LAUGHTER]

38
00:01:53,894 --> 00:01:55,268
SEAN BENNETT: Go ahead.

39
00:01:55,268 --> 00:01:55,900
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Yeah.

40
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,030
And I'm Sebastian.

41
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,100
At Google I do work like Google
self-driving cars and

42
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,310
involved in Google Glass.

43
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,370
Little small projects.

44
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,950
But I really care about
changing education and

45
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,270
bringing high quality
education to

46
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,090
everybody in the world.

47
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,389
And I think no better place
to start than Google.

48
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:10,160
KATHERINE MILLER: Wonderful.

49
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,715
Thank you.

50
00:02:10,715 --> 00:02:11,990
PETER LUBBERS: I'm
Peter Lubbers.

51
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,460
I'm Program Manager at Google
in the Chrome Developer

52
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,280
Relations Team.

53
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,030
Been with Google for
about a year.

54
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,610
And prior to that, I did a
lot of HTML5 training.

55
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,700
And been really excited just
working with this team and

56
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,570
taking the HTML5 training to
a huge scale that we're

57
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:29,080
seeing right now.

58
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,170
KATHERINE MILLER: And you really
live and breathe and

59
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,504
drive HTML5, don't you?

60
00:02:33,504 --> 00:02:35,070
PETER LUBBERS: And drive, yes.

61
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:35,260
[LAUGHTER]

62
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,610
PETER LUBBERS: We have the
HTML5 license plate.

63
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:37,302
[LAUGHTER]

64
00:02:37,302 --> 00:02:38,500
PETER LUBBERS: And Sebastian
here has the

65
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,677
Udacity license plate.

66
00:02:39,677 --> 00:02:40,671
[LAUGHTER]

67
00:02:40,671 --> 00:02:41,680
PETER LUBBERS: So we
came together.

68
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,520
KATHERINE MILLER: Excellent.

69
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,470
Excellent.

70
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,470
COLT MCANLIS: And I'm
Colt McAnlis.

71
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,640
I've been with Google almost
two years now.

72
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:46,960
Wow.

73
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,110
Time flies.

74
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,130
In my previous life, I was
actually a game developer for

75
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,840
about 10 years, making tons of
fun stuff, as well as an

76
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,290
adjunct professor at Southern
Methodist University Guildhall

77
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,610
School of Video Game
Development.

78
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,670
So it's really kind of nice to
be able to take all of that

79
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,940
expertise and find a
new place for it.

80
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,322
KATHERINE MILLER: Mmhmm.

81
00:03:02,322 --> 00:03:02,450
Excellent.

82
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:02,910
Excellent.

83
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,720
It was the--

84
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,070
I don't know what the word is.

85
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,320
It's not a trifecta--
quadfecta?

86
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:06,860
[LAUGHTER]

87
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,620
KATHERINE MILLER: Has come
together to make this

88
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,390
incredible thing happen.

89
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:15,050
So Sean, I'm actually going to
start and turn it over to you.

90
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,290
So what is this?

91
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,890
What has just launched?

92
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,810
SEAN BENNETT: So this is our
course on HTML5 game

93
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:21,070
development.

94
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:25,150
And really what it's about
is how do you take game

95
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:29,930
development principles that
we've learned over the past 20

96
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:34,450
or 30 years and port that to
building an amazing experience

97
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,950
on the web?

98
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,360
And we started this--

99
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:39,990
six, nine?

100
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,230
PETER LUBBERS: About
six months ago.

101
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,200
SEAN BENNETT: Six months ago?

102
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,950
PETER LUBBERS: Somewhere
around there.

103
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:43,410
[LAUGHTER]

104
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,976
COLT MCANLIS: Wow.

105
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:49,570
SEBASTIAN THRUN: And I met
Colt in a cafeteria here.

106
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:53,624
And he started spewing game
development stuff at me.

107
00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:55,058
[LAUGHTER]

108
00:03:55,058 --> 00:03:56,280
SEBASTIAN THRUN: And
he still is.

109
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:56,890
SEAN BENNETT: Yes.

110
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:57,682
[LAUGHTER]

111
00:03:57,682 --> 00:03:59,880
COLT MCANLIS: It was funny too,
because Sean's eyes just

112
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,425
went blank.

113
00:04:00,425 --> 00:04:02,855
Just like, hey, we we're
thinking about a course.

114
00:04:02,855 --> 00:04:03,920
And they're like cool--
blah, blah, blah.

115
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,240
And he just blanks.

116
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,680
[LAUGHTER]

117
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:05,930
SEAN BENNETT: Yep.

118
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:06,170
KATHERINE MILLER: And it really
goes to show you the

119
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,510
power of connectivity at
Google cafes as well.

120
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,660
SEAN BENNETT: It does.

121
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,300
PETER LUBBERS: Absolutely.

122
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,175
COLT MCANLIS: Good food
brings good times.

123
00:04:11,175 --> 00:04:11,725
KATHERINE MILLER: Excellent.

124
00:04:11,725 --> 00:04:12,000
Excellent.

125
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,640
Well, that's really exciting.

126
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,079
And this course has come
together on Udacity.

127
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,930
And it really has, in many
ways, a folkloric story.

128
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,520
When Peter came to
me and said--

129
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,800
I'm like, oh, I've
heard that story.

130
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,550
So I think we'd really to hear
from the horse's mouth.

131
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,910
So can you tell us a little bit
about how Udacity came to

132
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,410
be and what it really is?

133
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,480
SEBASTIAN THRUN: I give
you the Cliff Notes.

134
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,790
About two years ago, Peter
Norvig-- who's a director here

135
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,510
at Google-- and I tend to teach
this class, Artificial

136
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,570
Intelligence, at Stanford.

137
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,810
And we listened to Sal Khan
talk about how his Khan

138
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,130
Academy reached tens of
millions of kids.

139
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,930
And honestly, we got jealous
and inspired.

140
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,580
So we took our class online.

141
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,020
We sent out one email.

142
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,950
And we got 160,000 students.

143
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,350
And we were blown away.

144
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,590
But more so we were blown away
by the type of students.

145
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,700
These are people from
all trades of life.

146
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,560
Kids as young as 11 years old.

147
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,710
People really old.

148
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,240
Soldiers in Afghanistan.

149
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,980
Mothers raising kids alone.

150
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,660
So we felt we could reach
a huge number of people.

151
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,520
And we've taken this to a great
new level at Udacity.

152
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,500
We've been working with a number
of companies, Google

153
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,210
being one of them, to really
bring to people the type of

154
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,540
skills that they need in the
work force to really get ready

155
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,240
for jobs in this space.

156
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,750
If you look at HTML5, it's
singly the most exciting thing

157
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,310
happening in computer
science today.

158
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,700
And no college teaches it.

159
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,990
So you can't get that skill
in a university.

160
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:29,735
And why don't colleges
teach it?

161
00:05:29,735 --> 00:05:32,840
Well, it's so new that Google
cares about it.

162
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,260
And many other companies do.

163
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,880
But college professors haven't
quite caught up.

164
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,420
So we try to fill that gap.

165
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,490
KATHERINE MILLER: That's
really incredible.

166
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,690
And as I was chatting with
Peter yesterday, he said

167
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:46,440
there's actually a technology
tie in to how Udacity was

168
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,420
built, a connection
with Google.

169
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,240
So with our audience where we're
trying to inspire them

170
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,580
to be using Google technology,
we'd love to hear a little bit

171
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,557
about the underbelly
of Udacity if

172
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:57,830
you'd like to share.

173
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,010
SEBASTIAN THRUN: We would not be
alive without Google's App

174
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,270
Engine, without Google's
amazing expertise.

175
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,220
[LAUGHTER]

176
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,160
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Starting a
company that basically spans

177
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,450
all the way from instructional
design videos, quizzing, to

178
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,810
learning management, which is
the kind of [? source ?] that

179
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,370
keeps track of your progress.

180
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,230
To teach our portals and
[INAUDIBLE] teach us to

181
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,560
understand what's going on.

182
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,880
All within a year?

183
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,560
It would have been completely
impossible.

184
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,080
So now it's possible because
Google is just such an amazing

185
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,300
company with so many
amazing services.

186
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,010
But specifically excited that
we're also working with Google

187
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,550
in my home country on educating
the world and

188
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,855
bringing that content.

189
00:06:30,855 --> 00:06:33,070
KATHERINE MILLER:
That's amazing.

190
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,970
And Peter, now, the other
side of that.

191
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:39,230
You had this amazing idea for
a course and needed to bring

192
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,436
that to life.

193
00:06:40,436 --> 00:06:40,960
PETER LUBBERS: Yeah.

194
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,960
When I joined Google,
I'd come from a

195
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,840
background of HTML5 training.

196
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,820
But this was instructor-led,
fly to some other country,

197
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,860
teach 10 people for two days.

198
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,590
And when I joined Google, one
of, of course, the main things

199
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,260
is we do things at
a large scale.

200
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,327
[LAUGHTER]

201
00:07:00,327 --> 00:07:04,150
PETER LUBBERS: So it was like,
how do you scale that up to--

202
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,240
SEBASTIAN THRUN: 40 people.

203
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,810
PETER LUBBERS: Yeah.

204
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:06,150
[LAUGHTER]

205
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,060
PETER LUBBERS: How do
you double that?

206
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,650
And so the other thing at
Google, we're very interested

207
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,490
always in metrics.

208
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,150
And so one of the things about
a lot of the typical classic

209
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:18,610
online learning is you don't--

210
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,250
people go to a page.

211
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,090
They maybe look at a tutorial.

212
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,830
But we can't really tell whether
they've tried it.

213
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,050
A page view, ultimately,
is a vanity metric.

214
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,930
You can have 100,000
page views.

215
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,200
And nobody's learned anything.

216
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:37,170
So really it was kind of great
luck to kind of run into each

217
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:37,920
other in that space.

218
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,830
But we were really looking
at, how can we scale?

219
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,300
And how can we get
deeper metrics?

220
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,590
And now we can see who's
done a certain video.

221
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,660
But right after the videos--
and we'll talk a little bit

222
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,620
more about it later--

223
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,920
you get a challenge.

224
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,710
And you actually have
to do some coding.

225
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:56,250
And so with that in mind,
you really have--

226
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:00,180
we can see, hey, everyone was
able to pass this challenge.

227
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,210
But this one is really bad.

228
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,464
Probably reflects bad
on us as teachers.

229
00:08:03,464 --> 00:08:04,268
[LAUGHTER]

230
00:08:04,268 --> 00:08:08,523
PETER LUBBERS: But the deeper
metrics, the scale, it's a

231
00:08:08,523 --> 00:08:09,910
match made in heaven.

232
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:10,440
KATHERINE MILLER: Mmhmm.

233
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,730
That's really incredible.

234
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,990
And it's, in many ways, kind of
the philosophy of Google in

235
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,740
terms of trying new things,
building new things, getting

236
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,610
it out there.

237
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,830
Maybe having an amazing
moment.

238
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,390
Maybe having an oops moment.

239
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,442
And just kind of, what can
we learn from this?

240
00:08:23,442 --> 00:08:24,306
PETER LUBBERS: Exactly.

241
00:08:24,306 --> 00:08:26,540
KATHERINE MILLER: From a
pedagogical perspective for

242
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:31,980
teachers to have that instant
feedback is really powerful.

243
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,120
Is really powerful.

244
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,870
So Sean, a question for you.

245
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:39,179
And maybe for Colt as well.

246
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:42,340
You talked a little bit about
the importance of it being an

247
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,530
HTML5 course.

248
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,890
And really that this is
something that's so new and

249
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,760
innovative that it just
hasn't seeped into

250
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,990
standard curricula yet.

251
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:54,536
But why games?

252
00:08:54,536 --> 00:08:56,590
SEAN BENNETT: I just wanted to
teach a game development

253
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,340
course, honestly.

254
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,472
KATHERINE MILLER: Fair enough.

255
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:02,891
[LAUGHTER]

256
00:09:02,891 --> 00:09:04,900
SEAN BENNETT: It's actually--

257
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,220
I think I proposed this
to you about seven or

258
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,200
eight months ago.

259
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,520
And I was just talking about,
you know, it'd be really cool

260
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,230
to teach an HTML5 course.

261
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,565
And so we were trying to think
of motivating examples.

262
00:09:16,565 --> 00:09:18,890
And we're like, well, let's
build some games.

263
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:22,300
And then we got in contact
with Peter and Colt.

264
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,620
And it's like, well, how do we
go about building games?

265
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,740
I mean, we're not
game developers.

266
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,140
We don't know how this works.

267
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,601
[LAUGHTER]

268
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:29,660
COLT MCANLIS: You've got one.

269
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,444
[LAUGHTER]

270
00:09:31,444 --> 00:09:32,740
SEAN BENNETT: And more
importantly, how

271
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,400
do you teach it?

272
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,880
And I think one of the big
things here that we've learned

273
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,200
is that it's really important
to have code that you're

274
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,320
teaching around a project
that you're building.

275
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,650
A lot of our teaching is built
around, OK, they're going to

276
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,030
build this entire section
of the code base.

277
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,640
And they're going to understand
how it works at a

278
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,410
deep level.

279
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,730
KATHERINE MILLER: Mmhmm.

280
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,420
COLT MCANLIS: Growing up, I
had to teach myself how to

281
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,210
write video games.

282
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,340
This has been a passion of mine
since I was 12 years old.

283
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,400
I'm not gonna say how
old I am now.

284
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,090
But anyhow.

285
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,300
And early on--

286
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,190
imagine how much curriculum
you find now for

287
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,490
making video games.

288
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,610
It's in a lot of places.

289
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,310
Back then it was not.

290
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:14,100
And all through that sort of
toil coming up to becoming a

291
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,270
professional in the industry,
I always remembered, man, I

292
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,900
wish I could give something
back, which is why I got

293
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,960
involved with education
at SMU.

294
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,080
And one of the things that
always bothered me about

295
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,210
having something more standard
like that is that it's so slow

296
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:25,910
to turn around.

297
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,275
And that's why I love
getting involved

298
00:10:27,275 --> 00:10:28,590
with the Udacity stuff.

299
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:33,130
We were able to take from
concept to first bits on the

300
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:36,730
screen in six months a full
course that's touching almost

301
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:41,270
50,000 users across the world
with a brand new technology

302
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,560
that everyone wants to know
and everyone wants to be a

303
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,660
part of that's literally on
the cutting edge of game

304
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,810
development.

305
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:50,870
Day-to-day, we get emails and
comments and people coming to

306
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:54,720
us asking about, how do we
make great HTML5 games?

307
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,590
And the fact that we have
a solution for that and

308
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,370
education for these people,
it's really--

309
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,335
it's mind blowing.

310
00:10:59,335 --> 00:11:02,440
KATHERINE MILLER: And it really
seems, as well, that

311
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,150
the games is many ways the
mechanism that they're using

312
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,120
to learn the HTML5.

313
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,850
So it can in many ways serve
both of those purposes, both

314
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:15,530
creating something cutting edge
but actually creating

315
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:16,420
cutting edge games.

316
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,135
So it has kind of those
dual purposes.

317
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,170
PETER LUBBERS: I think one
additional thing to add to

318
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:24,500
that is the games tend to push
the boundaries of what's

319
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,980
possible on any platform.

320
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,820
That's true for desktop
applications or anything.

321
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,032
They demand so much
from the platform.

322
00:11:32,032 --> 00:11:35,280
And it's a great way-- if it
works for games, then it will

323
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,090
probably work for--

324
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,794
[LAUGHTER]

325
00:11:37,794 --> 00:11:39,490
PETER LUBBERS: Less
intense sites.

326
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,960
And just to add to that as well,
this course is built

327
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,705
around an actual
existing game.

328
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:49,450
And so it's a full-blown game
that Colt actually worked on

329
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,640
for months with a small team.

330
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,190
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah.

331
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,690
That's actually worth
pointing out.

332
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,400
So having almost 10 years in
game development background,

333
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,250
the first thing what I did
when I came to Google was

334
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,310
said, hey, HTML5
is a big thing.

335
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,213
Let's actually take game
developers' view and apply it

336
00:12:04,213 --> 00:12:05,220
to the technology.

337
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,380
Until that time, we'd heard a
lot of web developers trying

338
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:08,920
to make games.

339
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,280
And of course, they're coming
to that skill set from a

340
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,630
completely different
viewpoint.

341
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,990
So we actually got two or
three other [? x ?]

342
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,520
[? game ?] developers who
are working at Google.

343
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,830
And we sat down for about 120
days and said, let's make a

344
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:22,900
game in HTML5.

345
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,720
Let's take our viewpoint
and how we do it.

346
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,542
And that's where the GRITS
game came from.

347
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:28,850
SEBASTIAN THRUN: And
it's actually

348
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,780
funny because I view--

349
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,960
this is a course so
close to my heart.

350
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,820
I think all of education
should be games.

351
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,350
And being educated should be a
gaming experience where you do

352
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,980
something and you get
to the next level.

353
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,890
And before in Angry Birds,
you learn how to operate

354
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:43,780
slingshots.

355
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,860
And now you can play the game
of how to learn how

356
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,540
to program a game.

357
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,072
Which is really cool.

358
00:12:48,072 --> 00:12:49,420
KATHERINE MILLER: Excellent.

359
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,250
That's really incredible.

360
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,470
And Sean, what we'd love to do
now is actually turn it over

361
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:58,450
to you to show the website and
what it's actually like to

362
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,150
take the course.

363
00:12:59,150 --> 00:12:59,850
SEAN BENNETT: Sure.

364
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,050
We can go ahead and look
at the site right now.

365
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,550
I've got it pulled up here.

366
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,720
So this is the main
Udacity site.

367
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,090
It's got a number of
courses up on here.

368
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,600
And you can see HTML5
game development.

369
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,420
KATHERINE MILLER: And with that,
can you actually just

370
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,900
use that as a chance to talk
about what type of courses you

371
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,765
do offer through Udacity?

372
00:13:16,765 --> 00:13:17,570
SEAN BENNETT: Absolutely.

373
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:17,750
Yeah.

374
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,430
I think the main differentiator
with our

375
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,770
courses at Udacity
is interaction.

376
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:25,785
It's not about passive
learning at all.

377
00:13:25,785 --> 00:13:31,360
And so if we go in here to
our classroom, which the

378
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,910
instructor is currently
setting up.

379
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,630
And you can see that
we come to a video.

380
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,355
And it looks like Peter is in
the middle of a canvas unit.

381
00:13:38,355 --> 00:13:41,480
He hasn't finished it yet.

382
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,610
And there's a short video.

383
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:46,510
But then after that, you
immediately get taken to a

384
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,190
coding section where the
student has to--

385
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,458
SEBASTIAN THRUN: It's kind
of flashing right now.

386
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:51,286
SEAN BENNETT: Oh,
it's flashing?

387
00:13:51,286 --> 00:13:51,700
OK.

388
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:51,770
Oh.

389
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,030
Is it good?

390
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,900
SEBASTIAN THRUN: No.

391
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,645
SEAN BENNETT: No?

392
00:13:54,645 --> 00:13:54,950
OK.

393
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:55,320
[LAUGHTER]

394
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,060
SEBASTIAN THRUN: It's
a flashing game.

395
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,920
SEAN BENNETT: Flashing game.

396
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,470
It's a flashing game
apparently.

397
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,110
COLT MCANLIS: We're
not using Flash.

398
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:00,590
[LAUGHTER]

399
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,740
COLT MCANLIS: It's HTML5.

400
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,985
I can guarantee you.

401
00:14:02,985 --> 00:14:04,790
SEAN BENNETT: We're having
some technical issues.

402
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,310
So go to the site.

403
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,800
But like I was saying, I think
the main thing is student

404
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,630
interaction.

405
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:14,090
That's the primary difference, I
think, that our pedagogy has

406
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,800
that other platforms
don't necessarily.

407
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,540
And that's certainly
more traditional.

408
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,671
Lecture halls do not have.

409
00:14:21,671 --> 00:14:22,500
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Yeah.

410
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,670
I guess the wisdom here is the
only way to learn how to be a

411
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,280
game developer is
to write games.

412
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:27,800
SEAN BENNETT: Yeah.

413
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,340
SEBASTIAN THRUN: So anything
else is secondary.

414
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,580
You can have an instructor
that helps

415
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,670
you and assists you.

416
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,250
But if you don't write games,
you're not going to become a

417
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:33,690
game developer.

418
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:34,580
And that's what we're
tyring to do.

419
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,380
So if you go there, you
will write games.

420
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,850
COLT MCANLIS: And game
developers, in all of my time,

421
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,620
I've found that they are the
most impatient developers I've

422
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,000
ever worked with.

423
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,460
[LAUGHTER]

424
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,390
COLT MCANLIS: Because they see
Angry Birds and they see

425
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,280
Temple Run 2.

426
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,940
And they go, I can make that.

427
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,940
And they want their
game in the store

428
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,280
in like three months.

429
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,030
And that's what I love about the
Udacity format, is that it

430
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,200
literally puts them in the
driver's seat and says, learn

431
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,260
it by doing it.

432
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,030
And that's the way game
developers work.

433
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,490
We're very impatient.

434
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,495
We want it done and we
want it done now.

435
00:15:02,495 --> 00:15:05,290
SEAN BENNETT: And I think
project-based education is

436
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,570
just very powerful for, not only
teaching you what to do,

437
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:12,550
but also giving you kind of a
portfolio at the end of things

438
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,620
that's like, this is something
I've built

439
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,310
that I can point to.

440
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,820
It's not a piece of paper
that is maybe worth

441
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,200
something, maybe not.

442
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,840
It's, I've done this.

443
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,785
And that's a really
powerful feeling.

444
00:15:21,785 --> 00:15:23,720
KATHERINE MILLER: And actually,
that leads in

445
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,290
beautifully to the next
question, which was actually

446
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:30,520
going to be not just the
pedagogy behind this game, but

447
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,000
really behind Udacity
as a whole.

448
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,480
And the massive online
open courses.

449
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,880
So I think you started to hit at
that, that there's kind of

450
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,570
something consistent in all of
your courses, which is kind of

451
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,750
being program, problem-solving
based around.

452
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,650
That people aren't just
passively learning, but

453
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,540
they're actually going to be
creating something throughout

454
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:52,940
the course.

455
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,025
Would you say that that's--

456
00:15:54,025 --> 00:15:55,220
SEAN BENNETT: Oh, absolutely.

457
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,060
Do you want to add to that?

458
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:56,580
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Yeah.

459
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,880
Obviously, all my own learning
has been by trying something

460
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,330
and failing and then getting
up and trying it again.

461
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,820
And I've never gotten much out
of listening to professors.

462
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,540
Myself included.

463
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,860
[LAUGHTER]

464
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,210
SEBASTIAN THRUN: But
[INAUDIBLE].

465
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,550
Rather than thinking about like
online MOOCs as taking

466
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,980
the lecture and putting it
online, we think of it as

467
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,720
taking the exercise and
putting those online.

468
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,200
Because those are
much more fun.

469
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,585
And we want this kind of--

470
00:16:20,585 --> 00:16:22,130
we almost want this
gamification

471
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,150
effect on our students.

472
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,570
Like they get into a challenging
situation and it's

473
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:28,120
really hard and they spend
hours trying to solve it.

474
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,830
But when they solve it, they
solve it themselves.

475
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,970
And they can fall asleep
saying, wow.

476
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:32,995
I did this.

477
00:16:32,995 --> 00:16:36,230
These are, for me, the most
powerful moments of life, when

478
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,070
I succeed in solving
a problem.

479
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,985
And I think the same should
be true for our students.

480
00:16:39,985 --> 00:16:42,400
SEAN BENNETT: To me, it's
actually pretty similar to

481
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,180
puzzle design and games.

482
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,050
Is that you have to make the
player actually figure it out.

483
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,950
You can't tell them
how to do it.

484
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,730
But there's a right level.

485
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:52,480
You can't be too easy.

486
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,500
It can't be too hard.

487
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,490
It has to have that
part where, oh.

488
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:55,810
Yeah.

489
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:56,910
I get it now.

490
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,552
And that's a hugely
powerful moment.

491
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,830
PETER LUBBERS: I think a lot of
people approach any sort of

492
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:06,119
online class, also, with what
they know from the past.

493
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,349
So they say, oh, yeah.

494
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,250
It's just a video.

495
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,900
And then when they actually
look at it

496
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,720
they're like, oh, wow.

497
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,980
This is actually completely
different.

498
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,609
This may actually
be even better

499
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:15,119
than what they expected.

500
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,230
So it's a mind shift for many
people as well to just get

501
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,655
into this for the first time.

502
00:17:20,655 --> 00:17:21,880
KATHERINE MILLER: Absolutely.

503
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,930
And I think that you did touch
upon this a little bit, the

504
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:29,580
distinction between a MOOC
environment versus it being a

505
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,010
more traditional environment.

506
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,910
But especially for those of you
who have been professors,

507
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:39,000
have you seen a shift towards
this type of instruction in

508
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,710
classrooms?

509
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:44,190
Or do you still see that right
now, these online courses are

510
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:47,820
the place that this innovation
in pedagogy is happening?

511
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:51,360
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Well, to be
fair to traditional colleges,

512
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,090
a lot of professors
try to do this.

513
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,260
Like if you go to humanities,
you get your homework

514
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,805
assignments and you spend the
in-class experience discussing

515
00:17:57,805 --> 00:17:59,380
it rather than lecturing.

516
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,870
In engineering, lecturing
is the dominant mode.

517
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:04,865
And it's the only way you can
manage maybe 30, 100 students.

518
00:18:04,865 --> 00:18:07,050
It's just the best you
can do in class.

519
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,943
The nice thing about the online
is we can do stuff you

520
00:18:08,943 --> 00:18:10,600
could never do in a classroom.

521
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,990
Online can wait for you.

522
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,660
You can watch the same
video twice.

523
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,510
Or five times.

524
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,490
Or 10 times.

525
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,770
You're given as much time as it
takes to become a master.

526
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:21,710
There's no December 14 final
exam comes along and if you

527
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:22,640
aren't prepared, tough luck.

528
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,350
We give you like a
failing grade.

529
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:24,900
No, no.

530
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,760
You have another month.

531
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,860
And just take your time.

532
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,190
And get to the point where
you know how to do it.

533
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,700
That's something you
just cannot do

534
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,600
in a physical classroom.

535
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,702
And that's what you
get at Udacity.

536
00:18:33,702 --> 00:18:35,830
KATHERINE MILLER: And I think
there also, you mentioned

537
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:38,070
this, about one of your
passions is the

538
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,670
accessibility piece.

539
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:44,100
And I was having fun with this
question beforehand, because

540
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:50,170
some of our guests have fears
of alien ants and zombies.

541
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,750
And my thought is, wow.

542
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,710
This is amazing.

543
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,250
If they're holed up in their
houses avoiding zombies, they

544
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,820
could still access
this course.

545
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,780
But I think there's probably
a deeper nugget there from

546
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,470
accessibility as well.

547
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,145
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Yeah.

548
00:19:02,145 --> 00:19:03,170
You can do game development
even under zombie attacks.

549
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:06,300

550
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,690
SEAN BENNETT: What else
are you going to do?

551
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,180
COLT MCANLIS: Udacity should
definitely be part of

552
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,910
everyone's emergency
zombie kit.

553
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,330
[LAUGHTER]

554
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:16,270
COLT MCANLIS: You can use
that, by the way.

555
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,620
[LAUGHTER]

556
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,870
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,846

[LAUGHTER]

559
00:19:22,838 --> 00:19:24,610
KATHERINE MILLER: But
there is something

560
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,050
deeper to that as well.

561
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,610
SEAN BENNETT: Absolutely.

562
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:28,520
Yeah.

563
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,510
I think the most powerful
way to point

564
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,550
this out is that almost--

565
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,480
actually larger than 70% of our
student population in this

566
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,270
course right now is
international.

567
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,390
They're not US students.

568
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,470
And they're from all over.

569
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:45,480
It's not a few countries here
that really stand out.

570
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,630
It's India.

571
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,400
It's Eastern Europe.

572
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,970
It's everywhere.

573
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:50,870
PETER LUBBERS: The
Netherlands.

574
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:51,510
SEAN BENNETT: Yeah.

575
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,900
We have a lot of people
in the Netherlands.

576
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,900
We actually have a number of
people in Ghana, I think.

577
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,360
It's really, really impressive,
just how

578
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,990
widespread it is all
over the world.

579
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:01,790
KATHERINE MILLER: Absolutely.

580
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:01,990
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Yeah.

581
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,910
And if you look at it, 7 of the
10 most fastest growing

582
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:05,850
economies are in Africa.

583
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:06,510
SEAN BENNETT: Yeah.

584
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,740
SEBASTIAN THRUN: It's an
amazing place to be, an

585
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,960
amazing continent to be.

586
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,850
And there, I think traditionally
education is

587
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,420
much harder to get by.

588
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,696
And I think what's going to
happen is they're just going

589
00:20:14,696 --> 00:20:16,540
to leapfrog us and
everybody else in

590
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,360
their education medium.

591
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,020
And obviously, with an enormous
distribution of cell

592
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,740
phones and mobile, there's an
opportunity to really go out

593
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,480
and educate those people.

594
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,300
KATHERINE MILLER: Yeah.

595
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,550
That's really incredible.

596
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,030

597
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,360
Switching gears a little bit.

598
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,920
So Colt, you have had the
experience of teaching at SMU

599
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,010
as you mentioned.

600
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:40,510
And now you're teaching with
Udacity in this is much

601
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,650
larger, more scaled
environment.

602
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,920
What's that experience
been like?

603
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,050
COLT MCANLIS: It's
been fantastic to

604
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,690
be honest with you.

605
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:49,110
Teaching at SMU was great.

606
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,620
The fact that they have an
entire school dedicated to

607
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,610
game development curriculum
was fantastic.

608
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,540
There was always a little
bit of sort of a focus

609
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,420
issue for me there.

610
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,750
Because you always walk this
line about what data you're

611
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:05,180
serving that has to deal with
the curriculum for getting the

612
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,990
piece of paper at the
end of things versus

613
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:07,900
what's super relevant.

614
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,650
And I'm still actually
in contact

615
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:10,550
with a lot of my students.

616
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,680
During my time there I probably

617
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,510
had about 120 students.

618
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:16,130
And they'll still send me
messages and ask me questions

619
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:19,000
and say, I'm having this
problem in my career.

620
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,510
And that's been amazing.

621
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:23,810
What we're seeing-- and the
reason for that is because

622
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:26,440
they allowed me to come to the
table and give them these

623
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,400
stories about game development,
and teach in a

624
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,640
way that fit that setup.

625
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,740
And the great part about
Udacity is it's

626
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,430
like that on steroids.

627
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,920
If you actually take our canvas
courses, you'll get

628
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,850
sort of our cool little nuggets
of information about

629
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:42,900
the games industry.

630
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,770
Dangerous Dave and copyright
infringement.

631
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,090
[LAUGHTER]

632
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,880
COLT MCANLIS: Loading times
in [? Detroit ?]

633
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,040
Prime.

634
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,780
That's really just, at the
heart of it, so cool.

635
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,355
And the fact that there's
already so many students that

636
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:57,370
are on the message boards
finding the problems, fixing

637
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,360
issues, answering
each other's--

638
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,130
don't take this the wrong way.

639
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,810
But as an instructor, that
makes my job really easy.

640
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:02,636
[LAUGHTER]

641
00:22:02,636 --> 00:22:04,910
COLT MCANLIS: When you've got
40,000 students answering each

642
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:08,460
other's questions, you
never feel alone.

643
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:08,860
That's great.

644
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,060
SEAN BENNETT: And there's
more to that, too.

645
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,010
When you're answering another
student's questions, in my

646
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:16,565
experience learning how this
course works and the code base

647
00:22:16,565 --> 00:22:19,080
and everything, you learn
more by teaching than

648
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,760
any other way probably.

649
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,160
I'm not a game developer.

650
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,740
And part of the challenge here
for me was learning how this

651
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,680
code actually works, how
this game works.

652
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,640
And why it works the way it
does, I think is probably the

653
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,236
thing that took the longest.

654
00:22:35,236 --> 00:22:37,140
COLT MCANLIS: You and Calvin
had the hardest job.

655
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,080
Because you had to translate
all this gobbledygook in my

656
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,380
head and put it into
normal human speak.

657
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,040
So hats off to these guys.

658
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,245
They worked overtime on
being translators.

659
00:22:49,245 --> 00:22:50,940
KATHERINE MILLER: Excellent.

660
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,120
One thing that I think is really
interesting from what

661
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,290
you've said, though--
especially the

662
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,430
interactivity piece--

663
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,220
I actually have a background
in higher education.

664
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:03,370
And when this massively open
online coursework started

665
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:09,690
coming out, my first reaction
was, how does that work with

666
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,250
some of the benefits or
potential perceived strengths

667
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,510
of a more traditional
environment?

668
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:17,190
Kind of the infrastructure of
the student body and academic

669
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:20,470
affairs and all of those things
that can, hopefully,

670
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,230
drive people to success.

671
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,150
But it sounds like,
in many ways--

672
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:27,050
I think the word somebody had
mentioned was self-governing.

673
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:30,480
It seems like these people
have actually created

674
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,480
communities that are keeping
them enrolled in the courses

675
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,115
and moving forward.

676
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:38,180
SEBASTIAN THRUN: We live
in the 21st century.

677
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,520
And it's time for us to go
to the 21st century now.

678
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,830
KATHERINE MILLER: I know.

679
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,960
When I was studying, it was
right on the border of that

680
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,820
21st century.

681
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,935
So we hadn't quite tipped the
balance in my classes yet.

682
00:23:47,935 --> 00:23:49,560
SEBASTIAN THRUN: I had this
painful experience.

683
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,220
I'm trying to partially cover
curriculum with the way it's

684
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:52,640
being taught.

685
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,205
And do some crazy great
things like just go to

686
00:23:55,205 --> 00:23:57,050
HTML5 and just do it.

687
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:59,170
And in the class curriculum,
there's something called

688
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,710
factoring polynomials.

689
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,860
It's like you take a long
polynomial and you have to

690
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,020
break it into pieces.

691
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,440
And I'm a Stanford professor.

692
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,960
I've done math all my life.

693
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,550
And I've never ever factored a
polynomial in my entire life.

694
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,930
And I know nobody in the planet
who would know-- anyone

695
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,735
who should care about factoring
polynomials.

696
00:24:13,735 --> 00:24:16,150
So I got together a whole bunch
of educators and said,

697
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,230
let's make a video on motivating
to students why

698
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,180
they should care about factoring
polynomials.

699
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,110
And there's no answer.

700
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,810
[LAUGHTER]

701
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:24,810
SEBASTIAN THRUN: It's like, some
mathematicians wrote it

702
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:27,330
into the books a long time ago
and said this is part of it.

703
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:29,220
And you'll be foregoing all
these other opportunities.

704
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,680
I think if I had a choice and
go to a 16-year-old and

705
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,530
[? say ?] learn about factoring
polynomials or learn

706
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,950
HTML5, you should learn HTML5.

707
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,944
Because that's so much cooler.

708
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:41,030
PETER LUBBERS: In fact,
I can attest to that.

709
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,556
I have a 15 and a
17-year-old son.

710
00:24:43,556 --> 00:24:44,472
They'd agree.

711
00:24:44,472 --> 00:24:44,930
[LAUGHTER]

712
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,830
SEBASTIAN THRUN: I think there's
a lot to be done.

713
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:49,610
I think everybody should be
able to be a teacher.

714
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:51,340
Everybody should be able
to be a student and a

715
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,480
teacher at the same time.

716
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,940
Being a teacher is the best
way to be a student.

717
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,970
We should discover what makes
teaching go well.

718
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,420
I just refuse to believe that a
lecture class with like 500

719
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:02,290
and kids and a professor
lecturing chemistry is the

720
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,960
best that society can do.

721
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,840
It's probably the best you
could do 300 years ago.

722
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,660
But guys, wake up.

723
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,235
We live in the 21st century.

724
00:25:09,235 --> 00:25:10,560
KATHERINE MILLER: Fair enough.

725
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,610
Fair enough.

726
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:19,070
So with that, an interesting
thing that we are doing with

727
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,550
this is a little bit
of a hybrid model.

728
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:23,040
There actually is an
in-person component

729
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,750
to this, isn't there?

730
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,890
SEAN BENNETT: That's right.

731
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:25,053
Yeah.

732
00:25:25,053 --> 00:25:26,700
So we're trying something
new out.

733
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,480
And really excited about it.

734
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,750
It's basically a study group.

735
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:35,270
So we are launching,
basically, a

736
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:38,470
unit or two per week.

737
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,510
And what we figured is there's a
lot of people-- for example,

738
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:44,350
I run the San Francisco
HTML5 user group--

739
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:48,300
there's a bunch of Udacity
Meetups in the Bay Area.

740
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:54,100
And we said, why don't we get
together a nice room-- like

741
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,150
100 people can fit
in this room--

742
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:59,450
and do like office hours
or study group?

743
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:02,560
And so what was interesting
about that is, we will also be

744
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,760
live streaming that.

745
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,690
So starting next week, on
Wednesday-- and we'll put the

746
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:08,940
link to that--

747
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,530
we're going to have, basically,
a series of-- well,

748
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,310
it starts on Wednesday.

749
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,130
But it's going to be
every Monday night.

750
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,374
And we're going to be--

751
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:16,771
[LAUGHTER]

752
00:26:16,771 --> 00:26:18,882
SEAN BENNETT: Well,
Presidents' Day.

753
00:26:18,882 --> 00:26:19,800
PETER LUBBERS: Exactly.

754
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,010
Yeah.

755
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,560
Because of the holiday.

756
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,040
So we're going to be doing this
for about eight weeks on

757
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,250
Monday nights.

758
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,745
And so we'll be there--

759
00:26:27,745 --> 00:26:30,350
Colt, Sean, myself
will be there.

760
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,130
Maybe Sebastian will be there.

761
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,220
SEBASTIAN THRUN: I hope so.

762
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,220
PETER LUBBERS: And we'll
actually deal

763
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:35,750
with people's problems.

764
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:39,600
So the idea is people would
take the course.

765
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,050
They will do everything
in a unit.

766
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:47,605
And then bring all their
questions to the live stream,

767
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:48,580
to the room.

768
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,720
And we'll deal with
all the questions.

769
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,240
And we'll have a Moderator
up like we had for today.

770
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,010
So really trying to couple
that a little bit.

771
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,760
At least for the first
eight weeks.

772
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,560
We're not going to keep doing
that indefinitely.

773
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,740
And of course, after that, it's
completely self-serve,

774
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,310
the same as everything else.

775
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:07,316
But it'll be an interesting
experiment.

776
00:27:07,316 --> 00:27:11,230
KATHERINE MILLER: And have any
of your other courses had this

777
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,180
hybrid component to them?

778
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,440
SEAN BENNETT: The closest we've
come, I think, is Office

779
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,040
Hours when we originally
started, where we would just

780
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,790
have videos that we
would put up.

781
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,320
Students would ask questions
in the forum.

782
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,080
And then the most popular
questions, we would answer in

783
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,850
a short segment and put
them up on a more

784
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:26,860
or less weekly basis.

785
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,450
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Yeah.

786
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:28,860
So Peter and I had
a Google Hangout.

787
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,130
It was also broadcast
over YouTube.

788
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:34,080
And we had 12,000 students at
the same time online just

789
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,500
listening to their
conversation.

790
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,910
And we picked student
questions.

791
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,350
And we didn't pick all
12,000 obviously.

792
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,826
[LAUGHTER]

793
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:41,570
SEBASTIAN THRUN: We used a
Google Moderator to have

794
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:42,240
people brought [? up ?]

795
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:42,790
[? all these ?]

796
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,280
questions.

797
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,640
And even 12,000 students don't
have 12,000 questions.

798
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,690
They have maybe 20,
30, 50 questions.

799
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:50,050
PETER LUBBERS: Well, that's
precisely the huge

800
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:50,895
benefit of the scale.

801
00:27:50,895 --> 00:27:52,330
SEBASTIAN THRUN: And the
interesting thing was, half

802
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,430
the questions were
technical and the

803
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,280
other half were personal.

804
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,250
Like, what does it mean
to work at Google?

805
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,690
What does it mean to work
in the United States?

806
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:00,180
As a German-- or
as a European--

807
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:00,780
how to get there.

808
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,170
And it was really interesting
to see how much people

809
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,240
benefited from that
discussion.

810
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,040
KATHERINE MILLER: I see.

811
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,660
It really does seem like
they're just really

812
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:12,420
interesting, innovative ways
to be making it scalable,

813
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:12,835
accessible.

814
00:28:12,835 --> 00:28:16,910
And yet at the same time really
addressing the benefits

815
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:18,880
of what it is to be
in a classroom.

816
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,750
That while the lecture format
may no longer be as relevant,

817
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,150
there's still the benefits
of interacting with the

818
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,110
professor, interacting with
your fellow students.

819
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,350
And it sounds like you've
come up with some really

820
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:32,750
interesting ways of doing that
without removing the human

821
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,800
element, if you will.

822
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,310
PETER LUBBERS: Yeah.

823
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,490
We didn't want to just, OK.

824
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:36,120
It's finished.

825
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:36,850
Goodbye.

826
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:37,920
We'll move on to the
next project.

827
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,620
We want to really also
learn from--

828
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,560
clearly there's ways that
we can improve.

829
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,750
And we can get a much closer
look if we keep the finger on

830
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,450
the pulse of what is
actually happening.

831
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:49,230
COLT MCANLIS: And I was very
excited because there was a

832
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,840
lot of crazy game developer
stories that we had to leave

833
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,352
out of the course that
I now have a medium

834
00:28:54,352 --> 00:28:54,725
to give to the people.

835
00:28:54,725 --> 00:28:55,619
[LAUGHTER]

836
00:28:55,619 --> 00:28:58,700
COLT MCANLIS: So if you want
more crazy developer stories,

837
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,480
come to these study groups.

838
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,550
SEAN BENNETT: Don't do it.

839
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,504
Don't do it.

840
00:29:02,504 --> 00:29:06,320
[LAUGHTER]

841
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,570
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

842
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:11,567

843
00:29:11,567 --> 00:29:12,390
KATHERINE MILLER: Excellent.

844
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,330
Excellent.

845
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:16,310
And with that, I'm not sure if
these are statistics that you

846
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:18,950
can share or address,
but success rates.

847
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:24,400
So kind of x% of students enroll
and over a certain

848
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,120
percent of time there's
a certain

849
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,680
completion rate with classes.

850
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:27,900
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Yeah.

851
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,680
The completion rates.

852
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,990
They waver between
20% and, say, 8%.

853
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:34,000
And they're to be taken
with a grain of salt.

854
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,790
Because it's so easy
to enroll.

855
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,250
You just go to the
site and enroll.

856
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:40,160
And in fact, in the past, half
of all classes were taken by

857
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,190
people who didn't even enroll.

858
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,960
And we didn't count them
in the statistics.

859
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,450
But staying through
a class is effort.

860
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,480
Learning is not easy.

861
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,000
It's like weight loss.

862
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,800
A lot of people sign up for
the gym and don't go.

863
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,210
And they think they're going
to lose weight that way.

864
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:53,945
And if you really want
to learn HTML5, you

865
00:29:53,945 --> 00:29:54,640
have to come to class.

866
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,390
And have you participate.

867
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,110
And that's hard.

868
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,590
KATHERINE MILLER: It's
not just osmosis.

869
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,860
SEBASTIAN THRUN: And these are
real, challenging classes.

870
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:07,198
These are not watching YouTube
animated comic strips.

871
00:30:07,198 --> 00:30:08,430
KATHERINE MILLER: Absolutely.

872
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:13,690
So, Colt, many of the people who
are on the stream now are

873
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:14,930
maybe enrolled.

874
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,040
Some may not.

875
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,860
For those who haven't gotten
started yet or maybe partway

876
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,300
or even are considering,
why should

877
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,875
someone take this course?

878
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:24,440
COLT MCANLIS: Ah.

879
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:24,930
Great question.

880
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:25,640
KATHERINE MILLER: Yeah.

881
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,150
COLT MCANLIS: So this all, in my
opinion, goes back to what

882
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:31,550
does a degree say about
your skill set?

883
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:34,760
And for game developers, any
time you've been in an

884
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,610
interview, the person looking
at your resume says, do you

885
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:38,220
have a degree?

886
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:38,520
OK.

887
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:38,840
Check.

888
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,130
Then you go to the interview
process.

889
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,540
And you realize that you get
questions that have nothing to

890
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,610
do with your undergraduate
curriculum or anything.

891
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,980
You actually get yjr
in-the-trenches questions.

892
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:50,270
And that's what we've tried to
present in this course, is

893
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:55,240
what does it really take
to write an HTML5 game?

894
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,890
Not write an HTML5 app
or an HTML5 webpage.

895
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:01,940
Write a game leveraging the
power of HTML5 technologies.

896
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,980
And so the students that are
in this class, if you're

897
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:07,090
interested in writing games
and you want to make HTML5

898
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:10,030
your primary method of choice,
this is the right place to be.

899
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,280
Because you're going to get
that in-the-trenches

900
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,310
experience, that in-the-trenches
technology

901
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:16,510
that you can't find in
tutorials, you can't find in

902
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,710
standard academia.

903
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:20,260
This is really the primary
place to get it.

904
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,430
And Udacity's done a great
job of actually

905
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,070
exposing this to the users.

906
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,610
So if you want to make
games, start here.

907
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:27,750
KATHERINE MILLER: Got it.

908
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:32,610
And Sean, there's a little bit
of an incentive built into

909
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:34,350
this as well, isn't there?

910
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,250
SEAN BENNETT: Yeah.

911
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,150
There is.

912
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:36,810
SEBASTIAN THRUN: For
us or for them?

913
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:38,582
[LAUGHTER]

914
00:31:38,582 --> 00:31:39,911
KATHERINE MILLER: Everyone.

915
00:31:39,911 --> 00:31:40,990
SEAN BENNETT: Everyone.

916
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:41,850
So, yeah.

917
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:44,730
We're running a contest that
we'll be announcing and

918
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:48,990
putting a link up to where
you build your own game.

919
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,220
And we'll be voting on them.

920
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,430
We'll have students vote on it
and we'll also be judging

921
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:57,030
games that people make by
the end of the course.

922
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:01,880
And the winners get some fairly
interesting prizes.

923
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,750
Do you want talk about that?

924
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,570
PETER LUBBERS: Yeah.

925
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:03,980
Sure.

926
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:07,530
So I worked on getting at least
one ticket to Google I/O

927
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:10,600
this year, which as anyone
that's been trying to get a

928
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,330
ticket knows, that's really,
really hard to get.

929
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,240
COLT MCANLIS: I'm not
even sure I'm

930
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,040
allowed to go this year.

931
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,942
[LAUGHTER]

932
00:32:16,942 --> 00:32:18,295
PETER LUBBERS: Probably not.

933
00:32:18,295 --> 00:32:19,200
SEAN BENNETT: That's
a good thing.

934
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,300
PETER LUBBERS: It
was your ticket.

935
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,250
[LAUGHTER]

936
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,070
KATHERINE MILLER: We'll
talk offline.

937
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:24,895
COLT MCANLIS: OK.

938
00:32:24,895 --> 00:32:26,440
PETER LUBBERS: And
then, of course,

939
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,820
the other grand prize--

940
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:32,870
SEAN BENNETT: And the other part
of the grand prize is a

941
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:36,140
future cameo appearance
in a Udacity course.

942
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:36,790
PETER LUBBERS: Right.

943
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,140
KATHERINE MILLER: Very cool.

944
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,460
PETER LUBBERS: Full trip
paid and everything.

945
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,055
SEAN BENNETT: Yeah.

946
00:32:40,055 --> 00:32:40,830
We'll get you out here.

947
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:43,113
We'll put you in a course
for a [? bit. ?]

948
00:32:43,113 --> 00:32:44,990
SEBASTIAN THRUN: And if
I happen to be with a

949
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:45,920
self-driving car--

950
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,815
SEAN BENNETT: Yeah, who knows?

951
00:32:46,815 --> 00:32:48,270
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Take
you for a ride.

952
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:48,755
[LAUGHTER]

953
00:32:48,755 --> 00:32:50,160
SEBASTIAN THRUN: It's
really cool.

954
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,830
SEAN BENNETT: But the thing I
like about this contest is

955
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:55,110
it's not actually about
completing the course.

956
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,030
That's not the goal.

957
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,980
The goal is actually
building something.

958
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:01,460
Building your own game or
building a game with a group

959
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,630
of your friends.

960
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:06,040
And that's, I think, the power
of this course and the power

961
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,790
of what we can do with this.

962
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,780
KATHERINE MILLER: Excellent.

963
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,220
Those are the questions
that I have.

964
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,820
Before we move over
to the moderated

965
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:17,360
questions, any final comments?

966
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,282
Have I hit them all?

967
00:33:19,282 --> 00:33:20,638
PETER LUBBERS: I think so.

968
00:33:20,638 --> 00:33:21,540
KATHERINE MILLER: Excellent.

969
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:26,860
Well, we've had a very, very
active Q&A board going on.

970
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:30,450
So I'm really excited to
jump right into those.

971
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:34,490
So that the first one that
we have is for Colt.

972
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:37,190
And the question is, is a game
like the one we are building

973
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,280
during the course--

974
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,140
one that uses canvas
and Box2D--

975
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:44,520
is it portable to a native
mobile app using PhoneGap or

976
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,460
similar technologies?

977
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,300
COLT MCANLIS: Ah.

978
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:46,640
Absolutely.

979
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,790
This is one of the great things
about writing in HTML5

980
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:52,040
technology is, at its core,
it's really built to span

981
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,540
devices and a number
of mediums.

982
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:56,300
Now, when you're using PhoneGap
or sort of web view

983
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,240
components, you have to do
some modifications to the

984
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,180
source code, especially dealing
with the fact that

985
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,140
PhoneGap doesn't have
WebSocket support.

986
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,000
So you actually have to go get
the socket.io plug-in and

987
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,409
install that for PhoneGap.

988
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:10,190
There's tutorials on how
to do this online.

989
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,300
But the core principles
are there.

990
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,310
The core principles work.

991
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:14,560
The standard source
code works.

992
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,409
Besides there's some
modifications you have to do

993
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:17,730
with the native wrappers.

994
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,400
But other than that, that's one
of the great things about

995
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,270
HTML5, is the technology.

996
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,100
It definitely is there.

997
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:22,810
And it's definitely usable.

998
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,540
KATHERINE MILLER: Great.

999
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,310
And we'll continue
with you for the

1000
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,344
questioning for the moment.

1001
00:34:27,344 --> 00:34:27,994
COLT MCANLIS: All right.

1002
00:34:27,994 --> 00:34:31,260
KATHERINE MILLER: The Udacity
HTML5 game programming course

1003
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,780
content, will it have basic or
advanced content such as

1004
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:38,000
Physics, HTML5 database,
WebSocket, additional

1005
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,840
JavaScript libraries?

1006
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,429
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah.

1007
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:39,900
Absolutely.

1008
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:44,280
So what we did when we took the
GRITS framework as a game,

1009
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,769
we actually split it into
two components.

1010
00:34:45,769 --> 00:34:48,090
There's the server side
and the client side.

1011
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:50,520
And this first class is actually
just all the client

1012
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,710
side components.

1013
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,250
Hopefully we'll get a chance to
do a server side soon, you

1014
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:56,870
guys on that side
of the table.

1015
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:59,890
So the client side stuff
actually involves a lot of

1016
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:04,040
things like canvas rendering,
physics, of course with Box2D,

1017
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,040
as well as other principles
that are needed for game

1018
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,050
development specifically.

1019
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:10,480
So talking about object oriented
patterns, entity

1020
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,580
patterns, how to load maps, how
to use editors properly,

1021
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,660
how to actually get your
sounds playing.

1022
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,630
Really, this first class is
everything you need to do to

1023
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:20,520
get pixels on the screen, sound
in your ears, and things

1024
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,320
bumping into each other
in awkward manners.

1025
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,450
Hopefully the next course, we
can actually talk about things

1026
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:28,740
like WebSocket, Node.js,
how to host things.

1027
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,820
How to actually get player
versus player environment,

1028
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,640
real time networking, collision

1029
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,020
detection that's all networked.

1030
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,420
There's many good things
to come out of it.

1031
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,160
KATHERINE MILLER: OK.

1032
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:38,600
Excellent.

1033
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,250
Thank you.

1034
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:43,530
Peter, this is a broader
question.

1035
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:46,410
Could you please post a roadmap
of web development the

1036
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,220
way you see it?

1037
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,200
There are endless--

1038
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,180
SEAN BENNETT: Wow.

1039
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,650
[LAUGHTER]

1040
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:51,630
SEAN BENNETT: Glad
you got that.

1041
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,340

KATHERINE MILLER: Maybe
this is good

1044
00:35:55,146 --> 00:35:55,950
feedback for marketing.

1045
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:58,770
[? Think I'm ?] asking
you and then you.

1046
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:00,730
There are endless resources
for education

1047
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:01,760
all over the internet.

1048
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,940
One might get lost quickly
without a guide.

1049
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,485
PETER LUBBERS: Wow.

1050
00:36:04,485 --> 00:36:05,860
That's a great question.

1051
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:06,680
Yeah, so--

1052
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:10,580
well, we're doing our part.

1053
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:13,540
I think, as Sebastian mentioned,
we're really

1054
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,640
excited to build more.

1055
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,120
And the exact details of when
the next course and all that,

1056
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:20,880
we don't have that yet.

1057
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,976
But we're very excited.

1058
00:36:22,976 --> 00:36:29,340
And clearly, it's not going to
be just this course or a

1059
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,630
series of courses on Udacity.

1060
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:34,550
We're actually working on a lot
of different initiatives

1061
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,510
around this.

1062
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:39,300
Things like WebPlatform.org to
sort of have the one canonical

1063
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,800
reference for all of the
documentation of the web.

1064
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,170
Great courses like this.

1065
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:49,570
There's other web development
courses.

1066
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:50,790
Yeah.

1067
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:53,500
If you follow us along,
we'll try to come

1068
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,330
up with this roadmap.

KATHERINE MILLER: Yeah.

1074
00:36:59,510 --> 00:36:59,910
It is.

1075
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:01,000
Any additional thoughts?

1076
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,790
SEBASTIAN THRUN: I
completely agree.

1077
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:04,195
[LAUGHTER]

1078
00:37:04,195 --> 00:37:05,157
PETER LUBBERS: Nice.

1079
00:37:05,157 --> 00:37:06,510
KATHERINE MILLER: Excellent.

1080
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:10,240
And Sean, this is a
question for you.

1081
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,850
What do you think about using
TDD or unit testing--

1082
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:16,780
actually, maybe it's a
question for Colt.

1083
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,510
Either can jump in.

1084
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:21,240
Using TDD or unit testing
for game developing?

1085
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,130
I have seen you use Jasmine
at the tests.

1086
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:27,230
Do you have plans to introduce
this technology at the course?

1087
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:27,980
SEAN BENNETT: OK.

1088
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,320
We are using--

1089
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,660
well, we were using Jasmine.

1090
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,590
We're switching over because
there have been a number of

1091
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:35,010
technical issues with some of
the grading, which we're

1092
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:35,780
working on fixing.

1093
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,110
Thanks for sticking with us.

1094
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:39,882
[LAUGHTER]

1095
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:42,110
SEAN BENNETT: But I would
love to do that.

1096
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:49,650
I think doing TDD or BDD is a
course, at least, in itself.

1097
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:52,210
So I don't think interleaving
it with this is really the

1098
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:53,746
right way to do it.

1099
00:37:53,746 --> 00:37:57,030
Colt, I leave it to you for
its bigger role in game

1100
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:57,395
development.

1101
00:37:57,395 --> 00:37:58,270
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah.

1102
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:00,290
So let's put it this way.

1103
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:03,290
Is that debugging is sad.

1104
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:04,750
Testing is awesome.

1105
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:07,220
So it's really bad to actually
have to drill through a

1106
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,450
million lines of code
to figure out

1107
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:09,580
why something's broken.

1108
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,730
It's really nice when a unit
test tells you it is.

1109
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,330
That being said, it
is not done in

1110
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:14,190
game development enough.

1111
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,620
Because a lot of the
game development

1112
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,250
process is very iterative.

1113
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:19,680
You have to imagine that you've
got designers and

1114
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,920
artists and programmers and
producers and business people

1115
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,130
all pouncing on top of you to
create this amazing piece of

1116
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:28,050
content that's going to
touch millions of

1117
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:29,310
people across the world.

1118
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:31,095
And because of that, you
have to iterate.

1119
00:38:31,095 --> 00:38:32,160
You got to be really quick.

1120
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,350
You got to put in code,
put in content.

1121
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:34,510
Rip it out because
it's not fun.

1122
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,940
Evaluate that feedback loop.

1123
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,790
And with that, there's not a
lot of testing done in unit

1124
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:40,850
systems and automation.

1125
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:42,140
And that's wrong, I think.

1126
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,330
I think we should add
a lot more of that.

1127
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:43,750
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Yeah.

1128
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,570
What you just described is true
for Google as a company.

1129
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:47,180
COLT MCANLIS: Exactly.

1130
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:47,660
Right.

1131
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,830
SEAN BENNETT: It actually sounds
like building a course.

1132
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:49,410
[LAUGHTER]

1133
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:49,960
COLT MCANLIS: Exactly.

1134
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,260
And that's why I think a lot
of it should be adopted.

1135
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,920
A lot of game developers take
the incorrect view that, hey,

1136
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,920
I'm going to write this code and
put it up there and make

1137
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,580
$1 million.

1138
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,950
And that code base is done.

1139
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,180
Well, that's incorrect.

1140
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,500
I've worked for companies that
were using code bases that

1141
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:06,320
were almost 12 years old and
still did not have unit tests

1142
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,140
anywhere in that code.

1143
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,230
So as a game developer,
learning this

1144
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,400
is a very good strategy.

1145
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,120
Not necessarily as a game
developer, just as a good

1146
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:12,960
software engineer.

1147
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,000
So I think there should be
more of it in game dev.

1148
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,580
If you're out there and you're
listening, definitely take

1149
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,888
advantage of it.

1150
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:19,200
KATHERINE MILLER: Excellent.

1151
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:19,900
Good message.

1152
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,394
[LAUGHTER]

1153
00:39:21,394 --> 00:39:24,860
KATHERINE MILLER: And you seem
really, really enthusiastic so

1154
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:25,960
I'm gonna throw you
another one.

1155
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,975
COLT MCANLIS: Sweet.

1156
00:39:26,975 --> 00:39:29,350
It's the caffeine, really.

1157
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:32,570
KATHERINE MILLER: Will you
also use some HTML5 game

1158
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:35,090
developer framework
like Crafty.js or

1159
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:36,570
LimeJS during the course?

1160
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:41,650
I know that these are the
basics with Vanilla JS.

1161
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,110
Maybe some framework
usage could be

1162
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,915
applied in SQL courses.

1163
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:45,570
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah.

1164
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:49,080
So our goal for this course
is to give you as much

1165
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,550
to-the-metal processing
as possible.

1166
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,900
We don't want to teach
you how to use

1167
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,860
someone else's framework.

1168
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,910
We want to teach you how to
write things from scratch.

1169
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,940
Because that's the difference
between teaching a man to fish

1170
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,800
and teaching a man
how to be a fish.

1171
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,630
I think that works.

1172
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:04,030
[LAUGHTER]

1173
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:04,930
COLT MCANLIS: Does that work?

1174
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:05,380
I don't know.

1175
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,280
SEAN BENNETT: Maybe.

1176
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,540
COLT MCANLIS: So the only actual
other library we use is

1177
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:12,500
Box2D.js, which is an entire
physics and collision library.

1178
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,310
And the reason we do that is
because we really didn't have

1179
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,640
enough time to teach
you everything

1180
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,070
about physics and collision.

1181
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,790
Besides that, we try
to keep any other

1182
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,040
frameworks out of it.

1183
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,380
In the future, like I said, if
we do get a chance to do some

1184
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,870
service side courses we're
gonna be talking about

1185
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,920
Node.js, Socket.IO.

1186
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,630
Basically these tack on
components that are really

1187
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:31,360
easy to drop in and provide
functionality that aren't part

1188
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,930
of your core game development.

1189
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,280
So maybe we'll see
a little bit more

1190
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,220
of that in the future.

1191
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,340
KATHERINE MILLER: Now a question
for you, Peter.

1192
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:42,690
HTML5 seems to have no solution
for protecting code.

1193
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,850
Are there any upcoming
technologies that look to

1194
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:46,780
protect my code from
unauthorized use?

1195
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,610
PETER LUBBERS: Yeah.

1196
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:52,520
That's definitely one of the
classic things that people

1197
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,020
will raise.

1198
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,670
That's like, all right, that's
a problem for my game.

1199
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:58,400
Of course, you have the standard
ways to obfuscate

1200
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,020
your code and things like that
and compress and so on.

1201
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:07,610
But that remains a little bit
of a point for people.

1202
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:11,190
Not sure if there's a lot of
immediate things coming out in

1203
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,080
the near future.

1204
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,740
SEAN BENNETT: [INAUDIBLE].

1205
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,160
PETER LUBBERS: I don't think
that's changing.

1206
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:20,180
In a way, the beauty of a lot
of the web is that you can

1207
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,200
view the source of it.

1208
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,340
That also has the downside
of viewing source on it.

1209
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,900
COLT MCANLIS: I've talked to a
lot of game developers about

1210
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:27,400
this problem.

1211
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,490
They're very hesitant about
protecting their assets when

1212
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:31,140
they move to HTML5.

1213
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,170
And there's a couple different
ways you can take it.

1214
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:37,480
First off is, you can view all
the source code for Gmail.

1215
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,340
Yet reverse engineering
Gmail is actually a

1216
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,180
pretty daunting task.

1217
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,670
And the code that actually ships
to the client, as far as

1218
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,310
game development is concerned,
is really just

1219
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:46,520
the tip of the iceberg.

1220
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,400
Like if you've ever done game
development, you realize the

1221
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,420
massive part of code and content
you generate is all on

1222
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:54,560
the back end with tooling and
setting up user databases and

1223
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,700
understanding content
creation pipelines.

1224
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,700
Compression, texture
generation.

1225
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:02,320
The tools involved are
monumental in scope.

1226
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,560
What the user actually
gets on the client

1227
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,660
side is really small.

1228
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,050
SEBASTIAN THRUN: So we
need another course.

1229
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:07,850
A back end course.

1230
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:08,200
PETER LUBBERS: That's right.

1231
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:08,820
COLT MCANLIS: I like
your style.

1232
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,016
SEAN BENNETT: Or maybe
a few courses.

1233
00:42:11,016 --> 00:42:13,890
PETER LUBBERS: But I mean,
really, what you get is

1234
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:16,190
there's so much rich
interactivity now on the

1235
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:21,600
client, the code that's doing
that is really not sort of the

1236
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,750
business logic.

1237
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:25,420
That doesn't have to
be shipped down

1238
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,090
to the client either.

1239
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:27,300
So, yeah.

1240
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,840
It's like Colt said.

1241
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,810
You have what you need.

1242
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:33,060
You're probably not going to
find a lot of secrets in there

1243
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,672
that people don't want
to give away.

1244
00:42:35,672 --> 00:42:37,480
KATHERINE MILLER: I see.

1245
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,700
And I think we're going to
continue speaking with you.

1246
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,670
Lots of game-oriented
questions.

1247
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:45,790
But others, please jump in
as you have responses.

1248
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:49,060
With the recent improvements
to WebRTC, do you think it

1249
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,370
would be possible to
create multi-person

1250
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:53,440
MMO voice chat systems?

1251
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,850
Thoughts?

1252
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:55,700
COLT MCANLIS: Yes.

1253
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,425
SEAN BENNETT: Yes.

1254
00:42:56,425 --> 00:42:57,010
PETER LUBBERS: Yes.

1255

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

1256
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:01,060
PETER LUBBERS: In fact, I'm
thinking it might be good for

1257
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,710
the Udacity platform.

1258
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:08,957
[LAUGHTER]

1259
00:43:08,957 --> 00:43:12,080
KATHERINE MILLER: The main thing
holding back web based

1260
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:15,100
games in my mind is a lack
of controller support.

1261
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:18,080
Do you know of ways either being
considered or already

1262
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,135
being worked on to
solve game input?

1263
00:43:20,135 --> 00:43:20,920
COLT MCANLIS: Absolutely.

1264
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:21,470
SEAN BENNETT: Gamepad.

1265
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:24,950
COLT MCANLIS: Gamepad support
was actually added to Chrome

1266
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:26,710
as of Chrome 18, I believe.

1267
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:29,710
This will actually support your
Xbox 360, as well as PS3

1268
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:30,500
style controllers.

1269
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,200
And I do believe this was part
of the spec and actually is

1270
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,440
inside of WebKit too.

1271
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,010
So that means you'll have
that access inside

1272
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:37,670
of Firefox as well.

1273
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:40,730
I don't know if there's any
other controller support APIs

1274
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:41,850
that are available there yet.

1275
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:43,860
I know there's some
neurocontrols that are sort of

1276
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:44,640
making their way around.

1277
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,130
And also connect controls
and things like that.

1278
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:49,880
But I know that the spec as it
is, you do get access to

1279
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,660
handheld controllers.

1280
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,540
KATHERINE MILLER: Excellent.

1281
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:56,480
So this, I think, probably
would love

1282
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,910
comments from both sides.

1283
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:00,900
Can you offer a certificate or
college credit or employer

1284
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,610
credit from Google for student
[? achievements? ?]

1285

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

1286
00:44:04,966 --> 00:44:07,710
[LAUGHTER]

1287
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:10,300
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Well, so
Udacity has gotten involved

1288
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,120
heavily in college credit.

1289
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,770
Not at the HTML5 class because
it's not a class that's being

1290
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:15,920
taught right now.

1291
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,510
But I would encourage everybody
who completes this

1292
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:20,680
class and is in colleges, go
to your college and say, I

1293
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:21,570
want this for credit.

1294
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:22,630
And see what happens.

1295
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:25,190
Because the skill you'll learn
is probably better and

1296
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:26,940
stronger than most computer
science classes

1297
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,050
I've seen in my life.

1298
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:30,080
And that's the way it
should be going.

1299
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,910
Employer credit.

1300
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:34,740
Udacity has helped students
find jobs, if you

1301
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:35,330
look student profiles.

1302
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:36,930
We have profile pages
and so on.

1303
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:38,360
We have about 300 or so--

1304
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,810
350, I think-- companies right
now look at those CVs.

1305
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:44,780
And they've been actually asking
for the kinds of skills

1306
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:47,660
that this course gives
to students.

1307
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:50,360
A lot of companies go to the
web right now and need

1308
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,250
interactive skills for
their products and so

1309
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:53,100
on for their websites.

1310
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,010
And they're becoming more
and more game-like.

1311
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:56,870
So it's a great skill to have.

1312
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:57,815
Is there guaranteed employment?

1313
00:44:57,815 --> 00:44:59,840
[LAUGHTER]

1314
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,490
PETER LUBBERS: No.

1315
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:02,360
But I think it's definitely
shifting.

1316
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,360
In the past, it was really
resume based.

1317
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,320
And now it's much more
like, OK, so you're

1318
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,460
a JavaScript coder.

1319
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,190
Well, where's your GitHub
repository?

1320
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:13,330
Like how are you-- if you're
not known in the community,

1321
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:15,420
then that's already
a red flag.

1322
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,490
And you can have all the resume
you want for that.

1323
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:18,930
So it's definitely shifting.

1324
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:20,700
Again, there's no guarantees.

1325
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,920
Take the class, get a job.

1326
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,650
SEAN BENNETT: Yeah.

1327
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:28,460
I think the employer credit is
much more portfolio based,

1328
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:29,460
essentially.

1329
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,940
I think if you have that,
then you're going to

1330
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:32,350
get employer credit.

1331
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:33,680
SEBASTIAN THRUN: The other
thing we've found is in

1332
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,810
talking to employers, that the
skills that are non-obvious

1333
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:37,740
that really make a difference.

1334
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,790
Usually the soft communication
skills.

1335
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:42,430
So in every class we find these
like 10 or 20 or 30

1336
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:44,130
students who are just immensely
good in helping

1337
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:45,430
other students.

1338
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:47,050
And that's something that
employers care about.

1339
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:49,420
Because no problem in real life
is ever solved with a

1340
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:49,985
single individual.

1341
00:45:49,985 --> 00:45:52,610
They're always solved with teams
of people that involve

1342
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:54,580
multi-disciplinary business
people and legal

1343
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:56,020
people and so on.

1344
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,510
So those are even [INAUDIBLE].

1345
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:00,040
So if you're engaged in the
class, I recommend to you,

1346
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:00,690
help others.

1347
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:03,010
That's actually a good thing for
yourself, for others, and

1348
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:03,870
for employability.

1349
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:05,850
SEAN BENNETT: We've actually
hired a few of them.

1350
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:07,746
[LAUGHTER]

1351
00:46:07,746 --> 00:46:08,570
SEBASTIAN THRUN: So
there you go.

1352
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:10,273
SEAN BENNETT: It works.

1353
00:46:10,273 --> 00:46:11,820
SEBASTIAN THRUN: They're
awesome people.

1354
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:12,321
SEAN BENNETT: Yeah.

1355
00:46:12,321 --> 00:46:12,525
They're amazing.

1356
00:46:12,525 --> 00:46:15,520
KATHERINE MILLER: It's
kind of the contest.

1357
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,920
Really, we addressed in some
of this as well in terms of

1358
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,740
the incentive to create
something that could go into a

1359
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:27,250
portfolio, as well as the
opportunity to guest star.

1360
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:29,270
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Or you
start your own company

1361
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:29,980
and make the next--

1362
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:30,970
KATHERINE MILLER: Exactly.

1363
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:33,390
SEBASTIAN THRUN: --Angry Birds,
and buy the company

1364
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:34,370
that didn't want to hire you.

1365
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:35,300
SEAN BENNETT: Yeah.

1366
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,160
[LAUGHTER]

1367
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,770
KATHERINE MILLER: Excellent.

1368
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:41,616
A Udacity question here.

1369
00:46:41,616 --> 00:46:45,360
Does Udacity also have plans to
host collaborative projects

1370
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,140
and maybe include top
students in the

1371
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,410
classes into those projects?

1372
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:51,200
Think this can be a significant
experience for

1373
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,940
students and may attract
more employers.

1374
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,590
SEBASTIAN THRUN: We
would love to.

1375
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:56,245
And I'll leave it at that.

1376
00:46:56,245 --> 00:46:59,700
SEAN BENNETT: We have a
secondary website that's

1377
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:00,840
Udacity projects.

1378
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,530
I forget what the
exact URL is.

1379
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:05,400
But where we've created for the
web development course,

1380
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:10,890
the basic one, where students
would host their blog or their

1381
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:14,330
project that they made after the
had completed that course.

1382
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:18,160
And a lot of them had really
cool ideas that were just

1383
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,650
little things that were
useful to them.

1384
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:21,530
It wasn't necessarily something
that they wanted to

1385
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:22,830
build for someone else.

1386
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:24,360
They're like, now I know
how to build this.

1387
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,150
So I want to.

1388
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:26,870
And I'm going to.

1389
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:27,340
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Yeah.

1390
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:28,770
That site-- it wasn't
collaborative.

1391
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:31,520
But one student from Germany
built a search engine for

1392
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,300
video games-- sorry, videos.

1393
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,610
And I showed it to the executive
team at YouTube and

1394
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:36,180
said, look.

1395
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,445
This is how your search or
[? access ?] of YouTube videos

1396
00:47:38,445 --> 00:47:40,230
should look like and this is
what we're doing right now.

1397
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:43,750
And without going into too much
detail, that specific

1398
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:46,360
piece of work was just
blow away amazing.

1399
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,780
It had a way to index many
videos at the same time.

1400
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:51,140
You could type in a keyword
like George W. Bush.

1401
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:53,780
And then it would find the
mentioning of all these names

1402
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,040
and all these videos.

1403
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,890
And then make a new
video that just

1404
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:58,280
superimposed all these mentions.

1405
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,510
And it was a really
cool experience.

1406
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:03,770
KATHERINE MILLER: Very cool.

1407
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:08,020
Shifting back to HTML5
and games.

1408
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:09,370
Little of an opinion question.

1409
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:12,788
The good and bad parts
of HTML5 games.

1410
00:48:12,788 --> 00:48:15,511
COLT MCANLIS: I'm gonna let
you take that one first.

1411
00:48:15,511 --> 00:48:16,280
[LAUGHTER]

1412
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,590
PETER LUBBERS: Well, of course
the good part, also a couple

1413
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:21,850
of other questions raised
is like the portability.

1414
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:25,130
Just having a link to a place
and being able to

1415
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:26,830
instantly play that.

1416
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:28,080
That's really the good part.

1417
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:32,410
The incredible reach
you would have.

1418
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:33,300
Bad part.

1419
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,880
Right now, there are certain
things, let's say we're

1420
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,360
talking towards everything
is moving to mobile.

1421
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:43,640
There are certain lower level
APIs like the device access

1422
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:48,330
APIs and things that are not
completely there yet.

1423
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:50,500
But it's moving very fast.

1424
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,350
Here at Google, we're working
really, really hard to make

1425
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:55,020
that happen.

1426
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:57,050
Getting closer and
closer to that.

1427
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:59,170
Sometimes you see a
specification for an

1428
00:48:59,170 --> 00:48:59,820
[INAUDIBLE] that then
needs to, of

1429
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:00,980
course, be an older browser.

1430
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,470
So it takes a little longer.

1431
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:05,210
But that might be a
bad part I guess.

1432
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:06,470
SEBASTIAN THRUN: The velocity
has been fast.

1433
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:07,130
It's quite amazing.

1434
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:07,510
PETER LUBBERS: Yeah.

1435
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:08,950
SEBASTIAN THRUN: I used to think
that you had to have

1436
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:11,620
lower level machine access to
do something interesting.

1437
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:13,584
And that's really
changing now.

1438
00:49:13,584 --> 00:49:15,230
COLT MCANLIS: And it's
getting a lot closer.

1439
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:18,230
And that's one of the pros and
cons I have for web game

1440
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:18,670
development.

1441
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:22,990
Is that you can and do a lot of
amazing things with HTML5.

1442
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:26,480
But you kind of hit the top of
the limit when you try to

1443
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,170
reach a certain experience.

1444
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:32,390
When you try to do more than
about 300 to 500 draws on a

1445
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:34,930
canvas per frame, you actually
kind of max out, even on

1446
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,330
desktop machines.

1447
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:38,890
So getting above that, getting
more of that performance, is

1448
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:40,540
going to be your cap.

1449
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:42,840
And game developers are
constantly demanding more.

1450
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:46,160
So if you're kind of doing a
2D environment type game,

1451
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,210
HTML5 works really well.

1452
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:48,950
If you're really trying to do
something 3D and immersive,

1453
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:50,740
you got to kinda go
over to WebGL.

1454
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:52,120
And that's got a whole
different suite of

1455
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,550
[? performance ?]
environments.

1456
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:56,470
One of the other bad sides is
that because the web is

1457
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:57,200
fantastic--

1458
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,720
or Chrome specifically
is great at

1459
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,010
actually being very secure--

1460
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:02,690
we reduce your ability
to get access to

1461
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:04,050
lower level file systems.

1462
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:06,440
Which means that we kind of get
rid of the ability that

1463
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,940
games need to actually
cache local content.

1464
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,810
So if you actually looked at
the latest statistics, most

1465
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:13,460
mobile games nowaday are
anywhere between one and four

1466
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:15,110
gigs worth of content.

1467
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:17,644
As you see this curve start
moving towards the web, you're

1468
00:50:17,644 --> 00:50:19,547
going to try to start
transferring four gigs through

1469
00:50:19,547 --> 00:50:23,470
a Wi-Fi connection to someone
in a coffee shop?

1470
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:25,100
This actually doesn't
work very well.

1471
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,660
And so I'm very concerned
moving forward about the

1472
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:30,870
ability to decompress content,
store content, game developers

1473
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:33,390
getting that content, first
pixel to screen.

1474
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:35,360
Getting rid of load bars has
been something that I've spent

1475
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,190
a lot of my career
trying to do.

1476
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:39,660
And now we're seeing all of
these same problems come back

1477
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:40,560
in HTML5 web development.

1478
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,040
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Do you think
there's gonna be solution for

1479
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,140
this for HTML5?

1480
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:48,170
That your phone just caches
vast amounts of data?

1481
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,800
COLT MCANLIS: So there are
some solutions in flight.

1482
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,590
Things like AppCache and index
storage and file system.

1483
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:55,580
And I think those
are good starts.

1484
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:58,050
I think I AppCache actually has
a lot of problems because

1485
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:01,300
it tries to obfuscate too
much from the developer.

1486
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:05,030
Game developers, we're used to
having control of the native

1487
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:05,870
file system.

1488
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:08,950
And because of that, we've got
30 years of technology that

1489
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:12,590
show us how to properly segment,
cache, flow, things

1490
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:13,770
along those lines.

1491
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:17,770
Until we get that level of
control in HTML5, I think

1492
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:18,820
we're going to have problems.

1493
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:20,860
So I hope we get
there one day.

1494
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:23,600
I really hope that web
developers realize that,

1495
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,360
again, games push the limits.

1496
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,400
And if we want to make web apps
great, we should support

1497
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,500
game development, because
that's really

1498
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:31,550
where you want to be.

1499
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:33,190
So I think--

1500
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:36,490
if you believe this too, email
your congressman or

1501
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:38,370
international political
representative

1502
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:39,070
or something else.

1503
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:39,590
SEBASTIAN THRUN: About HTML5?

1504
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:40,870
[LAUGHTER]

1505
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:41,720
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah.

1506
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:42,370
Absolutely.

1507
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:43,270
Absolutely.

1508
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:45,440
KATHERINE MILLER: You could put
a platform up about the

1509
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,130
Death Star.

1510
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:46,600
So--

1511
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:47,710
COLT MCANLIS: There you go.

1512
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:48,040
SEAN BENNETT: Yeah, exactly.

1513
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,540
SEBASTIAN THRUN: We have
remedial classes in math on

1514
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,148
the web as well for
congressmen.

1515
00:51:51,148 --> 00:51:53,124
[LAUGHTER]

1516
00:51:53,124 --> 00:51:57,340
KATHERINE MILLER: Just the
guests today have been

1517
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:58,940
incredibly generous
with their time.

1518
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:00,700
Wanted to do a quick
time check.

1519
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,670
We're coming up on
about 11:30.

1520
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:05,070
We have some additional
questions to ask.

1521
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:07,560
If people have a little bit more
time, maybe take a couple

1522
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:08,410
more questions?

1523
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:09,240
PETER LUBBERS: Sure.

1524
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,070
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

1525
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:10,250
KATHERINE MILLER: Excellent.

1526
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:12,500
PETER LUBBERS: Just want to
mention, we will go through--

1527
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,980
we're not going to get
to all the questions.

1528
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:16,010
There's been a just
incredible amount.

1529
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:19,290
We will go through afterwards
and answer all of them.

1530
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:19,650
Don't worry.

1531
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:21,105
[LAUGHTER]

1532
00:52:21,105 --> 00:52:21,930
KATHERINE MILLER: Great.

1533
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,030
So why don't we take two or
three more questions?

1534
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:24,670
That work?

1535
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:25,305
PETER LUBBERS: Sure.

1536
00:52:25,305 --> 00:52:25,530
Sure.

1537
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:26,110
KATHERINE MILLER: Great.

1538
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:28,960
I think you guys have hinted
at thoughts around this

1539
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,450
already, but what is the chance
of a part two course or

1540
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:35,310
other platform dependent
content?

1541
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:37,570
SEAN BENNETT: So I
think everyone

1542
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:38,630
would love to do that.

1543
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:39,360
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Yep.

1544
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,190
SEAN BENNETT: I think everyone
is ready to go ahead.

1545
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:44,200
The question is what
more do we do?

1546
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,760
Really, from my end,
I would love to--

1547
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,310
like you were talking
about PhoneGap

1548
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:49,630
and porting to mobile.

1549
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:53,570
I would love to do some content
on how do you actually

1550
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:54,270
port to a mobile?

1551
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:56,206
Because that's a huge market.

1552
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:58,070

thinking about it.

firm plans yet.

COLT MCANLIS: Really, step one
is everyone take a nap.

1560
00:53:16,222 --> 00:53:19,340
Because a lot goes
into this course.

1561
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:20,330
Calvin, go to the gym.

1562
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:21,120
Do some rock climbing.

One of the interesting things is
that if you guys loved this

of it, then definitely

1569

Get your friends to
take the course.

Let's make this a smashing
success so it's a slam dunk

1572
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,210
that more people are interested
in it and that we

1573
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:40,380
should definitely do
a second course.

1574
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:41,750
So email your friends,
email your family.

1575

Get your grandma to
take the course.

to program HTML5.

I'm actually impressed

00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,650
that you guys can talk about

SEBASTIAN THRUN: Having a baby,
there's a certain period

1584
00:53:54,974 --> 00:53:56,650
where you just don't want
to talk about it.

1585
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,060
And you're talking about a
second course already.

1586
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:00,810
I think all of Google is kind
of looking at the experience

1587
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:03,340
of this one class, see how
it comes together.

1588
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,640

What's the [? impression ?]
from the community.

1590
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:10,150
So, again, I should also
emphasize for you on the

1591
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:12,060
online, there's a lot of
flaws in the course.

1592
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:14,270
We have grading difficulties
and so on.

1593
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:16,080
We're redoing some videos.

1594
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,790
I got stuck in the course,
I should openly admit.

1595
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:20,190
But I'm not a very
good [INAUDIBLE].

1596
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,560
So send us suggestions.

1597
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:24,540
And be somewhat patient with us
as explore this new medium.

1598
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:26,830
It is going to be so much better
the next time around.

1599
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:27,800
And that's what we're
really shooting for.

1600
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,390
SEAN BENNETT: Yeah.

1601
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:31,680
I think that's one of the most
powerful things about these

1602
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,540
online courses, that we can
constantly iterate.

1603
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:34,860
If there are problems--

1604
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:36,736
and people have been amazing
about pointing

1605
00:54:36,736 --> 00:54:37,490
them out in the forums.

1606
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:38,790
They're sending the
emails about it.

1607
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:39,690
They really have.

1608
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:41,930
And they've been mainly positive
and like, hey.

1609
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:44,350
We know you've got a lot on your
plate and you've got all

1610
00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:47,000
these things that you're
trying to do.

1611
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,740
I'd really like it if you added
this or changed this or

1612
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:52,590
I wasn't sure what you meant
when you said this.

1613
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:54,310
And that's been amazing.

1614
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:57,360
And I think, going forward,
iterating and improving this

1615
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,236
course is going to be
really powerful.

1616
00:54:59,236 --> 00:55:01,680
KATHERINE MILLER:
That's great.

1617
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,080
One more quick question
before we wrap it up.

1618
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:07,260
And I think that this is quite
a pragmatic question.

1619
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:09,830
I would like to know, in this
course or another, different

1620
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:12,440
ways on how to monetize
a game.

1621
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:17,140
Which is actually something very
top of mind for work that

1622
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:20,490
I'm doing within marketing,
which is not just bringing

1623
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:22,260
technology and training.

1624
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,370
But what do you do with
it once you build

1625
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:25,820
that amazing portfolio?

1626
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:28,750
So any thoughts on that?

1627
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:30,272
SEAN BENNETT: That's an
additional course.

1628
00:55:30,272 --> 00:55:32,924
[LAUGHTER]

1629
00:55:32,924 --> 00:55:34,300
COLT MCANLIS: So
I'll say this.

1630
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:37,060
One of the reasons I've always
loved game development is you

1631
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:40,200
have to be great at everything
to be successful.

1632
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,650
You have to bring great content
with great technical

1633
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:45,690
chops with great marketing and
great reach and exposure.

1634
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:47,860
And all of these things have
to come together in this

1635
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:51,080
minute little, little
potential orb.

1636
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:55,120
And if this potential orb
doesn't get out to the masses,

1637
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,880
it just all fails apart.

1638
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,660
Marketing and monetization
are at the core

1639
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:00,540
of every game developer.

1640
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:03,260
Especially since 2009 when we
saw the indie developer

1641
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:06,990
explosion when smartphones came
on and when we saw the

1642
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:09,510
boom of social gaming come on.

1643
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:12,000
Everyone wants to leave their
big company right now, start

1644
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,640
their own company, and
do monetization.

1645
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,590
At its core, it's a very
difficult process.

1646
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:20,550
That being said,
there's tons--

1647
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:23,140
probably more now than ever--
of research in this area,

1648
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:26,220
documents in this area, people
specializing in this area.

1649
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:29,420
Understanding the tricks, the
nuances, should you use this

1650
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:30,880
word or that word?

1651
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,190
There is better statistics out
right now on the web about how

1652
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:36,720
to monetize your game and the
things you need to do than

1653
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,590
there are how to program
your game.

1654
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:40,530
So take that into account.

1655
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:42,300
And that's actually a
great suggestion.

1656
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,410
I think that's something worth
looking at moving forward.

1657
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:45,080
KATHERINE MILLER: OK.

1658
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:45,500
Excellent.

1659
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,420

new insect overlords.
