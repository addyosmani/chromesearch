1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,370

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,570
ALEKSEY: So we're back here at
Devoxx, and I'm here with Sam

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,900
Dutton to talk about
disruptive media.

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,630
That's what your--

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:12,930
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, absolutely.

6
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,190
ALEKSEY: --session was called.

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,660
So you're working on standards,
and you believe

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,530
standards can actually
help to create

9
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,110
stimulate content creation.

10
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,670
And by content creation, we mean
maybe are you an artist,

11
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,450
and we can bring to the
web something that

12
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:31,490
was not there today.

13
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,200
So tell me what--

14
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,440
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, sure.

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,480
We're really looking forward
to seeing what

16
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,120
people make of WebRTC.

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,050
I mean, at this point, it's been
kind of in the hands of

18
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,087
people who do telephony and
videoconferencing and so on.

19
00:00:43,087 --> 00:00:45,490
But I think what's really
exciting is what web

20
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:47,105
developers are going to make,
because they're going do a

21
00:00:47,105 --> 00:00:49,070
whole stack of creative
stuff with that now.

22
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:49,780
It's fantastic.

23
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,700
ALEKSEY: So WebRTC is just one
of the technologies, and we'll

24
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,670
talk about that.

25
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,500
Is that part of a bigger
picture, or is that the one

26
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,470
and only thing you need?

27
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:01,340
SAM DUTTON: So WebRTC has
several components.

28
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:09,260
So you need some way to get
streaming media to work with

29
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,580
WebRTC, so that has the
Media Stream API.

30
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,590
People have done some stuff
already, some great demos,

31
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,630
using getUserMedia with that.

32
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,520
And then the kind of meat of
the project is this thing

33
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,570
called RTC PeerConnection, which
is the bit that deals

34
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,110
with streaming data between
the two peers.

35
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,240
ALEKSEY: And peers
are browsers.

36
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,570
There's no--

37
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:27,630
SAM DUTTON: Yeah,
and a peer is

38
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,270
ALEKSEY: --separation
involved in there.

39
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:29,870
SAM DUTTON: No, that's right.

40
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:36,690
So just to kind of rewind a bit,
what we've had with the

41
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,470
internet is that with the web,
we've had this kind of--

42
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:39,790
I don't know--

43
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,320
kickstarting of the
information age.

44
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,450
We've had this ability to kind
of share information, to

45
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,310
create stuff and distribute it,
and then to discover stuff

46
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:52,720
and to actually consume content
and services and

47
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,990
media and so on.

48
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,430
Now, that's great, but there's
been this kind of missing

49
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,010
piece, which is the business of
kind of person to person,

50
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,270
like person-to-person
communication.

51
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,650
This is kind of one of the last
really major challenges

52
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,560
for the web.

53
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,660
And this is what we need with
real-time communication.

54
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,970
And that's what WebRTC
is bringing to us.

55
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:19,030
ALEKSEY: And this is what
used to cost a lot and

56
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,640
systems can do that.

57
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:20,830
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, yeah.

58
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,210
ALEKSEY: We technically
can do that today.

59
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:22,410
SAM DUTTON: Absolutely.

60
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:22,740
Yeah, sure.

61
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,430
ALEKSEY: But the web can make
that accessible to--

62
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,360
take it to the next level.

63
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:27,890
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, yeah.

64
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,000
So what we've had in the past
is kind of corporate closed

65
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,780
systems that have--

66
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,920
some have worked better than
others, but they've always

67
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,650
been expensive to implement and
difficult to integrate.

68
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,100
And of course, there's never
been a way to directly

69
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,690
integrate stuff with
your web apps.

70
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:48,900
What we have now is the use of
plug-ins like Flash, which

71
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,690
work well in many ways, but are
problematic and that are

72
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,500
essentially closed
and are separate.

73
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,490
And also thinking about
security, they're not part of

74
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,700
the sandbox browser
environment.

75
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,040
So WebRTC has also been built
with security in mind using

76
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,040
secure protocols, and because
it's within the browser,

77
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,070
continually updated,
sandboxed.

78
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,645
It's inherently more secure.

79
00:03:10,645 --> 00:03:12,040
ALEKSEY: So what do you send?

80
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,240
What kind of data
can you share?

81
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,510
I mean, developers care
about that, obviously.

82
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,330
SAM DUTTON: It's exciting to
think what people are going to

83
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:20,680
do with it.

84
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,820
So with WebRTC, the kind of
core of it is this idea of

85
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,450
voice and video calling.

86
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,470
That kind of makes sense.

87
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,970
So a lot of the optimizations
have been about working with

88
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,660
voice to essentially do what
you can do with telephony.

89
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,460
But we've also got this
ability to do really

90
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,890
high-quality video chat.

91
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:45,910
We're already seeing very good
quality, very low-latency

92
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,490
video chat, which
is fantastic.

93
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,360

94
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,870
The third part of the WebRTC
picture in a way is an API

95
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,400
called Data Channel.

96
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,240
Now, what that enables you to do
is arbitrary streaming data

97
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,960
between browsers.

98
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,340
So that's like anything.

99
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,440
So you could be streaming any
kind of arbitrary data, not

100
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,780
just audio video
data, anything.

101
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,910
So a stack of really--

102
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,730
I mean, who knows?

103
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:12,950
ALEKSEY: Oh yeah.

104
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,630
I can imagine quite a
few things already.

105
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,020
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

106
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,760
ALEKSEY: So maybe
for developers,

107
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,980
what does RTC mean?

108
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,899
I mean, where do they get
started, and why is it even a

109
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,079
good thing in the first place?

110
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,960
I mean, they like Flash today,
and maybe that-- so just for

111
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,510
the player, that offers
some solution.

112
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:26,880
SAM DUTTON: Absolutely.

113
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,100
So, I mean, we've talked to
Flash developers who've kind

114
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,000
of had some struggles and are
really pleased to hear about

115
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,710
the project, in particular
because it's--

116
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,260
you know, WebRTC provides--

117
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,700
they're just APIs within the
browser, so they're really

118
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,570
easy to integrate with your
existing workflow and your

119
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,690
existing web apps.

120
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:49,700
ALEKSEY: It is web development,
right?

121
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,300
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, it's
web development.

122
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,070
ALEKSEY: It's just another
API, right?

123
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,450
SAM DUTTON: It's not like you've
got to bring in the

124
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,560
Flash guy or the whatever, and
you've got people who work on

125
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,250
the web, who use the web, who
use the API, so that's the

126
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:58,860
first part.

127
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,380
The second big deal is that
there's no licensing.

128
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,140
Google has done a huge amount of
work on this stuff and made

129
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,190
it then open sourced and freely
available, so there's

130
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,690
no licensing for the developers

131
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,010
or for the end users.

132
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,340
So, it's good for everyone

133
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,240
ALEKSEY: OK, great.

134
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,350
So where should people go to
get started if they're

135
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,065
interested?

136
00:05:19,065 --> 00:05:21,580
And what does the next six
months or 12 months or two

137
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,630
years look like?

138
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,350
SAM DUTTON: So the place
to start with WebRTC is

139
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,680
webrtc.org.

140
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,020
It's the kind of natural
home for WebRTC.

141
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,200
There's articles
on HTML5 Rocks.

142
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,435
There's a book called "WebRTC
Book," a really nice books for

143
00:05:39,435 --> 00:05:40,030
the Kindle.

144
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,200
It's about six pounds
something.

145
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,220
It's cheap, about eight
euros, I think.

146
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,660
There's some great video, too.

147
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,740
Check out Justin Uberti's Google
I/O video, a really

148
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,240
good place to start.

149
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,870
And yeah, there's lots
of resources

150
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,830
online to get you started.

151
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,800
ALEKSEY: What does the roadmap
for WebRTC look like?

152
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,330
SAM DUTTON: So the next six
months, well, there's a lot of

153
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:07,480
work on keeping going with
standardization projects.

154
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,120
We want to integrate
Mozilla work.

155
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,700
WebRTC has just been implemented
in Firefox

156
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,500
nightlies in Aurora, and we
want to integrate the work

157
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,270
there with the work that's been
implemented in Chrome.

158
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,680
Obviously, there's a big
push now for mobile.

159
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,370
That's the kind of natural
home for personal

160
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,620
communication.

161
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,360

162
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,270
And then, of course, Data
Channel, to see an

163
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,080
implementation.

164
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,890
It is in Firefox, but we want
to see that in Chrome soon.

165
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:35,860
ALEKSEY: OK, wonderful.

166
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,790
So lots of things to look at.

167
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,520
SAM DUTTON: Yes, indeed.

168
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,650
ALEKSEY: Thanks, Sam.

169
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,340
SAM DUTTON: Cheers, Aleksey.

170
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,590
Good to talk.

171
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:47,960
