1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,310

2
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:03,620
ANKIT JAIN: Good morning,
everyone.

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,680
Morning.

4
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,980
So great to see so many of you
here so early on day three of

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,720
Google I/O. Last night I wasn't
sure if I was going to

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,400
make it this early.

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,460
My name is Ankit Jain and
I lead [INAUDIBLE]

8
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,530
Search & Discovery
for Google Play.

9
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,210
And I'm extremely excited to
be here and share this

10
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,940
material with you today.

11
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,960
As most of you know, we've never
discussed our search or

12
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,530
discovery engines publicly
before today.

13
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,140
But before I get started, I
wanted to get to know you guys

14
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:32,890
a little better.

15
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,580
So with a raise of hands, how
many of you are making money

16
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,520
on Google Play today?

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,685
OK, great.

18
00:00:39,685 --> 00:00:41,590
How many of you would like
to make even more

19
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,880
money on Google Play?

20
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,300
Great.

21
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,410
For those on YouTube, pretty
much everyone would like to

22
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,130
make even more money.

23
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:52,810
Let's step out of our normal
role as developers or business

24
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,560
owners, and for a second, let's
step into the shoes of

25
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,610
our users, and think
like a user when

26
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:58,910
you come to the store.

27
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,700
How many of you have installed
an app, just while browsing.

28
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,860
You were bored, you opened the
Play Store, saw something

29
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,780
interesting, click through
and installed it?

30
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,690
OK, how many of you have
installed an app because you

31
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,410
thought about, I need to get
something done, I need a

32
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:18,000
recipe app or I need to find
the train schedule, went

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,810
looked for it, and then
installed it.

34
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,040
That's a smaller portion.

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,980
And how many of you have
installed an app because a

36
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,590
friend of yours told you, hey,
you really have to go check

37
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:28,450
out this app.

38
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,780
And then you go to the Store,
look for it, and install it.

39
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,080
Great, so my goal today is to
talk to you about how we try

40
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,520
to bring these online and
offline thought processes of

41
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,430
how all of us install apps,
and how we try to get that

42
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,510
discovered on Play.

43
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,210
So I'm going to present you with
three high-level sets of

44
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:46,860
information.

45
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,970
The first one is our vision for
the new Google Play Store,

46
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,620
the second is some of the
details of the Search &

47
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,700
Discovery algorithms that we
have, and how you can take

48
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,510
advantage of them to get
discovered more, and, finally,

49
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:01,560
I want to leave you with five
very concrete examples of what

50
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,490
you can do to get discovered
more on Play.

51
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:05,780
Sounds good?

52
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,480
All right, great.

53
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,180
So let's get right into it.

54
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,540
A few weeks ago, we rolled out
the new version of the Google

55
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,580
Play Store.

56
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,960
It's very different than what
we had in the past.

57
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,170
About a year ago a group of us
stepped aside and said, if we

58
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,420
could re-imagine the entire
Store, the new Google Play

59
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,540
experience, what would
it be like?

60
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,540
The goal was to come up with
something that was dynamic,

61
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,140
very fresh, the user should be
trained and look forward to

62
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,870
coming back into the Store,
something that is

63
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,400
personalized, yet personal.

64
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,720
So some of you might
be thinking, Ankit,

65
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,960
what are you saying?

66
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,470
Personalized, yet personal,
what's the difference there?

67
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,600
Well, personalized to me is
something that is personally

68
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,350
relevant, related to what you've
told us in the past,

69
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,660
what you users have purchased;
what's personally relevant,

70
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,210
because it's popular in the
user's area; personally

71
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,920
relevant because the user has
shown interest in certain

72
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,860
categories or in certain
developers; or personally

73
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,880
relevant because your
friends are showing

74
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,180
interest in those things.

75
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,140
And then we want to take it to
the next level, we want to

76
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,250
make it personal by showing
you and annotating each of

77
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,130
these recommendations or each
of the pieces of content in

78
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,190
our Store with why you
should get it.

79
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,810
This could be a +1 by a friend,
this could be a review

80
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,110
by a friend, or this could be
something based on the new

81
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,810
Google Play Game services.

82
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,590
That should be and three others
are currently playing

83
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,720
"Puzzles and Dragons."

84
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,240
We should really tell the user
this is why you should get.

85
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,520
And our goal was to help each
and every one of you, each and

86
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,940
every one of our developers,
to get more engaged

87
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,270
installers, because at the end
of the day, that's what's

88
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,790
really going to move
the needle.

89
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,010
Those are the users that build
sustainable and great

90
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:40,780
businesses.

91
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,330
So our goal was threefold.

92
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,240
First, to help our users find
what they're looking for as

93
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,500
effortlessly and seamlessly,
and possible.

94
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,400
Second, to help Android ship
more and more beautiful apps.

95
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,810
And finally, to help all of you
build even more thriving

96
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,240
businesses on top
of our platform.

97
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,340
So let's get the meat
of today's talk.

98
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,250
Let's talk about our major
install source.

99
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,080
At the end of the day,
nothing can be built

100
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,130
unless you've got installs.

101
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,660
And specifically, I want
to talk about how

102
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,800
to get engaged installs.

103
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,529
So many of you reached out to me
in the past and said, hey,

104
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:20,180
I'm ranked number five, or
number 10, or number 50 on

105
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,750
these top lists, or on
these trending lists.

106
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,510
These are what I call our
browsing discovery features.

107
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,030
And I like to break them into
three sub-components.

108
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,020
The first are these top charts,
the top list, the

109
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,940
editor's picks, the
trending lists.

110
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,120
The next are the features
that we launched at

111
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,550
Google I/O last year.

112
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,740
These were the personalized
recommendations.

113
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,490
Some of you saw these as part
of the Google Play homepage

114
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,440
experience in the cluster there,
others might have seen

115
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,490
this on the widgets, on the
Nexus 7 and the Nexus 10 on

116
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,790
the home screens there.

117
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,160
And the last set of features
that we have for discovery

118
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,050
based on your context, are the
related and cross sell items.

119
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,150
These are the users who viewed
x, also viewed y on the

120
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,070
details page of all
of your app.

121
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:05,150
Also the other set which is
users who installed this app

122
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,270
also installed these other apps,
which is also on your

123
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,290
details pages.

124
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,370
And we'll get into details about
each of these and how we

125
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,310
look at them, and how the
algorithms are built.

126
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,160
What most developers don't think
to think about as much

127
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,280
is the search component.

128
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,940
And for the average app search
actually makes up the vast

129
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,730
majority of installs.

130
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,410
And when I think about search,
I like to break it down and

131
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,330
look at our query stream in
terms of two kinds of queries.

132
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,890
The first are the kinds of
queries that many of you

133
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,700
raised your hand for, which
are I had to get something

134
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,270
done, so I looked it up; I
needed to look up a recipe; I

135
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,210
wanted to find restaurant
reviews in a city that I'm in;

136
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,450
I want to find multiplayer
games or free

137
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,030
games, or RPG games--

138
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,705
the kind of categorical
queries.

139
00:05:47,705 --> 00:05:50,570
You know the general idea of
what you want or what you want

140
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,460
to do, and then you search
to find the right

141
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,830
app to fulfill that.

142
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,590
The second kind of query is
when you know exactly what

143
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,750
you're looking for.

144
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,810
This is when a friend has told
you about an app, or if you've

145
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:04,800
heard about it through
marketing.

146
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,560
Navigational queries, hey, I
want to get hotel tonight; I

147
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,120
want to get "Beautylish," or I
want to get "Angry Birds,"

148
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,840
which is not necessarily a
single app, it could be a set

149
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,640
of apps, but you know which
direction you want to look in.

150
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,040
That's navigational queries.

151
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,700
And just to show you how
important search is, in any

152
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,960
given day 12% of our active
users come back to the Store

153
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,110
and search at least
once for apps.

154
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,660
In any given week, half of our
users come to our Store and

155
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,360
search for apps.

156
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,580
And even given the number of
apps we have in any given

157
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,670
month, there's over six million
unique phrases that

158
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,500
are being searched for.

159
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,810
So really thinking about search
is important, as you

160
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:48,190
try to figure out how to
get discovered on Play.

161
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,600
So just to put what we've talked
about, we've talked

162
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,420
about our vision for Google
Play, and how our goal is to

163
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,360
present each user with a
personalized play made

164
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,410
personal; how Search and
Browse are the two main

165
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:04,080
sources of installs in the
Store; and finally, a lot of

166
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,390
this happens because our goal
is to bring the rest

167
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,220
of Google to Play.

168
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,860
That was the transition from
Android Market into Google

169
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,850
Play, it was to integrate all
of our systems together and

170
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:18,180
make Google Play a very smart
Store, make it your store.

171
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,820
So now that we've talked about
it, let's step back and think

172
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,030
about how we think of our Search
& Discovery systems.

173
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,490
When we build our search engines
and our discovery

174
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,930
engines, we have two options--
either we can spend a lot of

175
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,010
time trying to detect the apps
that are bad or spammy, or

176
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:35,740
simply annoying, or we can spend
a lot of time trying to

177
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,550
figure out which
apps are good.

178
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,960
And we spend a lot more time
focusing on what's good,

179
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,880
because if we can promote the
apps that are not just good

180
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,740
from what we can tell, based
on your APK, based on your

181
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,650
metadata, based on what users
are telling us about each of

182
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,900
the apps, then other users are
also going to find these

183
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,750
delightful experiences.

184
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,260
And so this part of the talk is
going to be talking about

185
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,020
how you can compliment your app
with good app metadata.

186
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,130
So the most important
piece of your app

187
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,820
metadata is your title.

188
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,110
It's important to be creative,
but it's just as important, if

189
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:13,170
not more important, to
been very clear.

190
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:16,590
So this example up on screen
is about an app named

191
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:20,100
"Beautylish." As you can see,
most of you might not have

192
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,220
heard of it, some of you might
have heard of it, but right

193
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,330
after you see the title, you
know this app is about makeup

194
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,450
and beauty tips.

195
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:31,120
So what this title helps you do
is it helps the developer

196
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,429
reinforce, not just their
branding, but also what their

197
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:36,340
app is about.

198
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,809
So as you see this more and
more often, either in the

199
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,850
Store, or even once you have it
installed in your list of

200
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,760
apps on your home screen, it's
very clear that "Beautylish"

201
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,280
is the app I go to for makeup
and beauty tips.

202
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,160
So I highly recommend thinking
about the name of your app.

203
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,600
It also helps a lot for SEO.

204
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,220
When someone looks up "beauty
tips" or "makeup tips", these

205
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,900
guys are at the top of that
list, just because everyone

206
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:04,070
associates the two of those
terms together.

207
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:07,050
The next important part of
your details page in your

208
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,880
metadata is your description.

209
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,990
You can write as long a
description as you want, but I

210
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:17,060
always say, get the main
message out first.

211
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,790
"Star Chart" does a
great job here.

212
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,150
Their first sentence says that
you can now have a virtual

213
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,070
planetarium in your pocket.

214
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,790
Again, if you've never used
this app, you already know

215
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,420
what it's about.

216
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,120
After that, you can go on
describe it in more detail,

217
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,110
list the awards you have, and
just have your sales and

218
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,680
marketing pitches for users.

219
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,050
But right up front, make
sure your user knows

220
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,060
what your app is about.

221
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,320
And on a smaller phone, that's
the part that's above the

222
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,280
fold, so you want to make sure
on that first screen itself

223
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,860
it's extremely clear what your
goal is-- what utility you

224
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,605
provide or what entertainment
value or whatever the goal of

225
00:09:51,605 --> 00:09:53,190
your app is-- what
it provides.

226
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,260
Now, that also again helps
a lot with getting found.

227
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,690
This app is extremely optimized
for star charts,

228
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:02,050
star maps, virtual planetariums,
so the beginning

229
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,020
of descriptions are extremely
important, both from a user's

230
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,690
perspective, and also from our
search engine's perspective.

231
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,250

232
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,590
The next couple of slides I'm
going to talk about how you

233
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:16,980
can use your app details page
to mimic the real user

234
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,030
experience.

235
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:21,450
It's important that you set the
expectations of your user

236
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,590
to be very realistic to really
be what your app

237
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,820
is going to be like.

238
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,040
The first place to do this
is in your screenshots.

239
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,320
In our developer console, we let
you upload screenshots for

240
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,530
tablets, for phones, and really
show the user what it's

241
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,950
going to be like once
you install the app.

242
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:39,700
Now, if you don't do this, and
your app experience is

243
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,100
actually very different from
your screenshots, it can have

244
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,160
a very negative effect on
all of your systems.

245
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,420
Why?

246
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:48,410
Because, well, the user loves
what they see in your details

247
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,180
page, they install your app,
they open the app, and then

248
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,750
they see something
very different.

249
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,130
What are they going to do?

250
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,050
Well, most users will
uninstall the app.

251
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,710
Some of those users will go back
to the Store and give you

252
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:02,290
a low rating, maybe even write
you a negative review.

253
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,920
And that negative feedback cycle
is going to hurt you

254
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,110
more than help you.

255
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:10,350
And so really thinking about
how do you present the user

256
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,970
with, setting the right
expectation and then

257
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,210
delivering on it.

258
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,140
That's the message here.

259
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:19,930
We're looking for apps that do
deliver on their promises.

260
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:24,280
Video previews are the next
level of screenshots.

261
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,560
With a short video you're able
to show the user really what

262
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,030
it's like to play
with your app.

263
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:33,240
And developers have told us
that uploading a video can

264
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,270
really help gain
user adoption.

265
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,870
And users in a lot of studies
have told us that video

266
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:41,440
previews are amongst the most
convincing features of an app

267
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,990
details page.

268
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,460
Again, the whole goal here
is to tell your user

269
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,710
what your app does.

270
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:50,070
If you can convince them and
make sure and communicate what

271
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:53,200
your app promises and then
deliver on it, you're going to

272
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,260
delight them, and they're going
to recommend you to

273
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,510
other users as well.

274
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,010

275
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,090
So I talked about reviews and
ratings in terms of the

276
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,070
feedback loop.

277
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:06,840
And this is a key part of our
Search & Discovery experience.

278
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,220
Now, the first piece of this
comes because people come back

279
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,760
and review your app, whether
it's good or bad.

280
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,810
The second piece is we really
try to order our reviews and

281
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:19,230
ratings in an order that is
relevant to the user.

282
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,120
So you're going to see reviews
that are on the same device as

283
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,730
the current user, in the same
country as the current user,

284
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:28,310
and as time goes on, people that
are in a user's circle or

285
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,020
people that the users trust are
going to come at the top

286
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:31,830
of these reviews.

287
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:35,220
So investing in making sure that
your users are reviewing

288
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,070
and rating your apps will be
key going forward, because

289
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:42,720
that's a very strong signal
for us at Google Play.

290
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,920
So I'm going to step back and
tell you a story about a

291
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,400
developer, a developer in India
that I was talking to a

292
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,980
few weeks ago.

293
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,530
And his goal was to target
the rural population.

294
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:56,340
As you can see on the graph
on the right, about 75% of

295
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,980
India's population lives
in rural cities.

296
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,140
But his goal was to target the
audience that had low- to

297
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,390
mid-end phones, and was on
slow to 2G networks.

298
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:08,890
So he had really optimized his
app to give a delightful

299
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,260
experience for these users.

300
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,970
But then he reached out to me
and said, Ankit, when I look

301
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:16,850
at my reviews, I have
this polarized view.

302
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:20,680
There's a whole bunch of stars
with people saying I could

303
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,700
never have imagined technology
would change

304
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,950
my world this way.

305
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:27,230
And also a lot of one stars,
with people saying, complete

306
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:30,620
crap, I can't believe I
downloaded this, uninstalling

307
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,470
it right now.

308
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,800
And he was perplexed, he wasn't
sure what was going on.

309
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,340
And we dug a little deeper.

310
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,240
And one of the things we
noticed was that he was

311
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,170
getting a lot of positive
reaction from the people in

312
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,390
rural areas, his target
audience.

313
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,450
And he was getting a lot of
negative reviews from the

314
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:50,260
people on the 4G networks, on
the top-of-the-line devices

315
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,270
because his app just was
not designed for them.

316
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,160
His goal was not to go
after that market.

317
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,140
And so the thing that he ended
up doing was he went to the

318
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:02,360
developer console and targeted
his app to the countries and

319
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,740
carriers where his target
audience really was.

320
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,110
And since then, he's already
seen an uptick in his average

321
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,350
reading and his reviews,
and hopefully that

322
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,230
continues over time.

323
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,490
But my message here to you
is think about who

324
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,020
you're trying to target.

325
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,550
For most apps, you don't have
to worry about this, you can

326
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,890
let your app get to everybody.

327
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:22,430
But if your app is targeted at
a specific set of the target

328
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:25,710
audience, make sure those are
the people helping you get

329
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,660
even more adoption.

330
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,810
You don't want people not in
your target audience polluting

331
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,520
your reviewer rating.

332
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,080

333
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,980
So we've talked about creating
a very creative, yet clear

334
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,680
message to your title and
description, to mimic your

335
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,520
real world experience through
your images, your screenshots

336
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,210
and your video previews; and,
finally, really about

337
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,650
understanding your audience.

338
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:51,660
This is what's going to
help you optimize

339
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,080
your app details page.

340
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,830
So let's see how this
manifests itself.

341
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,080
At the end of the day, there's
the top charts and the search

342
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,650
engines, what are the things
that we look for?

343
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,300
How, once you do all of these
great things in your app

344
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,400
details page, how does
it feedback?

345
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,830
And no search or discovery
system would be complete

346
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:11,650
without really taking into
account the statistics that

347
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,650
we're constantly collecting.

348
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:16,130
So the first piece of this, as
most of you probably already

349
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,780
figured out, are the installs.

350
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,450
Of course, we care about how
many installs each app has.

351
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,910
The more you have, the higher up
in the rankings you'll go.

352
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,960
We also care about how many
uninstalls you have, because

353
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,070
that's a metric for us to know
whether users are having a

354
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,690
good or a bad experience.

355
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,030
Now, some of you are game
developers out there, and you

356
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:36,240
might say, hey, my game overall
takes 1 gig of memory,

357
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,280
or 2 gigs of memory on
a person's device.

358
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,460
So after they're done playing
my game, of course, they're

359
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,390
going to uninstall my app,
because they want to

360
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,120
play the next game.

361
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,130
They've already won every
level there is.

362
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,020
Why are you going to hurt me?

363
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,670
And that's why we have
the third statistic,

364
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,240
which is long installs.

365
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,770
If a person plays through or
uses an app for a long period

366
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,630
of time, we don't want
to penalize it.

367
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:00,010
Our goal is really to detect the
behavior which is, hey, I

368
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,760
installed the app, I really
did not have a good

369
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,040
experience, so I'm installing
it right away.

370
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,560
So the long install
encapsulates that

371
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,050
phenomenon in it.

372
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,820
In the coming months, one of
the things that we want to

373
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,680
focus on is engagement, and
really understanding, for each

374
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,560
of your apps, when are people
using, how are they using it,

375
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,720
and how is it different across
different kinds of apps.

376
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,200
For example, Google Now, I just
go to it when I need to

377
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,460
pick up my latest
boarding pass.

378
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:27,370
I'm not going to spend tens if
not tens of minutes or hours

379
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,390
on it, but there might be a game
where I spend an hour or

380
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,190
two on it, but that doesn't
mean one is

381
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:32,940
better than the other.

382
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,420
They're just different
kinds of functions

383
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,680
that they're providing.

384
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,240
And this is an area where having
a conversation with all

385
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,250
of you is great, and I really
look forward to having some of

386
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:41,870
your feedback.

387
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,090
So a lot of this is about
setting the stage for the

388
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,750
first conversation we've never
discussed this before.

389
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,910
If you guys have ideas,
please let us know.

390
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,390
I'll talk about Google Play
services, the game services,

391
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,090
that we launched, and how we're
going to use that for

392
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,280
engagement in the coming
months as well.

393
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,410

394
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,670
Here's a query that I get very
often from developers.

395
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:06,099
Hey, for some search query, I'm
number three, even though

396
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:10,220
the app ranked above mine has
fewer installs and has a lower

397
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,390
rating than me.

398
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:16,069
I'm sure many of you have
thought about this as well .

399
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,829
Now, on the previous slide
I talked about

400
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,150
the uninstall rate.

401
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,380
Not only do we look at the
number of people that are

402
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,150
uninstalling your app compared
to the number of people

403
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:27,390
installing it, we also have
some amount of a recent

404
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:30,550
uninstall rate as well.

405
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,680
The idea here is that you might
have an app that has not

406
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,300
been updated in a couple of
years, and now more people are

407
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,510
uninstalling your app
than installing it.

408
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:42,720
Or there's a newer app or your
app could be on the other side

409
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,800
of this, where you made an
update and now a lot of people

410
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,210
are really keeping your app,
that's going to help you move

411
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:48,980
up in the rankings.

412
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:52,960
We want to make sure our users
are getting the best apps as

413
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,150
easily as possible.

414
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,210
So I hope this answers
this very common

415
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,460
question that I get.

416
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:03,530

417
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:07,470
So the other piece of what we've
talked about a lot at

418
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,130
Google I/O this year is
personalization across all of

419
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,180
our products at Google,
and Google plays no

420
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,470
exception to this.

421
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,400
We're constantly slicing and
dicing all of the data that

422
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,920
we're collecting in order to
personalize and improve each

423
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,520
user's experience.

424
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,980
I'll give you a couple
of examples.

425
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,360
The query "Yahoo" in the US
leads to people installing the

426
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,180
Yahoo app or the
Yahoo Mail app.

427
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,785
In Japan, however, people are
installing the Yahoo Japan

428
00:18:30,785 --> 00:18:33,500
app, and over time our systems
learned this and figured out,

429
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,020
hey, in Japan, show Yahoo Japan
as number one, in the US

430
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,860
show Yahoo and Yahoo Mail
as number one and two.

431
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,630
Similarly, on tablets, people
tend to install different apps

432
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,320
than they do on mobile
devices.

433
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,670
So, again, using the feedback
loops of what people are

434
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,510
searching for, what they're
clicking on, and what they're

435
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,380
enjoying installing, we're
able to really tailor the

436
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,390
search experience and the search
results per device

437
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:59,180
type, per locale, and across
a whole bunch of different

438
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,430
dimensions.

439
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,440

440
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,660
About a year ago, in addition
to having the search

441
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:09,020
suggestions as you type, we
added the ability to have

442
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,000
navigational search
suggestions.

443
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,890
These are suggestions that
Google believes are the right

444
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,060
one for a user.

445
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,750
So as this user is typing in
SUB, most users tend to

446
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,210
actually go straight to "Subway
Surfers," so we

447
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,740
allowed the user to do
that right from the

448
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,730
search suggest box.

449
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,820
If you click on that
navigational suggestion, you

450
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,170
won't go to a search
results page.

451
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,380
You'll go straight to the
app's details page.

452
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,310
It even shows you the icon of
the app that it's going to

453
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,600
take you straight to.

454
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,970
Now, if a user wants to find the
tips or the strategies, or

455
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:38,450
other apps that are around
"Subway Surfers," they can

456
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,220
still complete their query and
look at the app details page.

457
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,510
Again, the theme here is that
we're trying to make it easier

458
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:47,920
for users to get
what they want.

459
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,820
Let's switch gears
a little bit.

460
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,150
And I'll let you look at this
for a couple of seconds,

461
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,400
there's a lot of
data up there.

462
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:04,920

463
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:09,030
So a lot of you always have
asked the question, how are

464
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,290
your top lists generated?

465
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,320
When are they generated?

466
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,770
And what's the rationale
behind them?

467
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,680
Now, not like any search or
discovery system, we're

468
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,980
constantly tuning our systems.

469
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,370
And this is a snapshot of what
it looks like recently.

470
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:28,025
There's a basic quality barrier
that's there, there

471
00:20:28,025 --> 00:20:30,370
are some review and rating
metrics that we take into

472
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:33,920
account, but at a high level, we
create top lists daily per

473
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,880
country, per category, and
even for device type.

474
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,840
You guys saw some of the design
for tablet top list

475
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,930
that were launched
earlier at I/O.

476
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:45,100
And our top paid free and
grossing list are really

477
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,100
targeting first-time users to
Google Play, or people that

478
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,850
just got a new device, because
they're looking for the basic

479
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,650
apps that they need to
load up in order to

480
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,550
get their stuff done.

481
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,860
What's most popular
on Google Play?

482
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:59,120
The top new paid and the top new
list are targeting users

483
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,860
who have the basic apps and
say, hey, what's new right

484
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,940
now, what's new and popular?

485
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,270
And for that reason we limit it
to the apps that have been

486
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:10,220
published in the last 30 days.

487
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,220
And this is very important,
because many app developers

488
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,320
launch an app in a single
country and then over time

489
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,470
roll it out to a bunch
of countries.

490
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:21,420
So I get a question a lot of
times saying, hey, I just

491
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:25,830
launched in Italy last week,
and it's going gangbusters.

492
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,850
We're just getting more installs
than we ever have,

493
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,800
how come we're not in the
top and new free or

494
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,290
top new paid list?

495
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,630
Well, the reason is your
original launch might have

496
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:37,350
been six months ago, and so
you're not qualified to be in

497
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:40,510
the top new list of even new
countries that you launch in.

498
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:44,990
It's a global published
date that we look at.

499
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:47,170
So also think about your global
roll-out strategy.

500
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,900
If being in the top new list is
part of your strategy, that

501
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,800
30-day window is extremely
important.

502
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,050
And the metrics across these
are different, for the

503
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:57,860
grossing we look at the
revenues, for the others look

504
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:02,390
at installs over the
last several days.

505
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,200
The next list that I want to
talk about is our trending

506
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,440
list, and this is one that has
had no clarity about it ever.

507
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,110
Internally, we like to call it
our Movers & Shakers list.

508
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:16,390
Our goal here is to present the
user with a system that

509
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,800
can give them what's really
hot right now.

510
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,120
Amongst all the apps on Google
Play, what are the apps that a

511
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,980
lot of users, more than we
predict, are being installed?

512
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,540
So for every app we have a
predicted growth rate.

513
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,570
This predicted growth rate takes
into consideration where

514
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:34,860
in your app life cycle
you are, and how many

515
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,460
installs you have.

516
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:40,190
And then, if a given app
performs significantly better,

517
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,730
if it starts getting installs
much faster than what we

518
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,530
predict, it makes it
into this movers &

519
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,160
shakers, or trending list.

520
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,300
So when the soccer World Cup was
going on a couple of years

521
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:53,060
ago, the FIFA app was at
the top of this list.

522
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:56,220
Last year when the unfortunate
tsunami hit Japan, many

523
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,480
radiation tracking apps were
on the top of this list.

524
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,910
And any app can be part
of this list.

525
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:04,270
And we're looking at a 30-day
window to figure out really

526
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,670
what's hot right now.

527
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:08,770

528
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,510
I mentioned the Related
and Cross Sell

529
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,390
features that we have.

530
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,650
These are on every app's
details page.

531
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:17,160
They are the people who viewed
this, also viewed these other

532
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,450
apps, and the users who
installed this app, also

533
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:20,740
installed these other apps.

534
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,630
Let's go through
a few examples.

535
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,300
The first one's Bank
of America, a user

536
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,770
looking to do banking.

537
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,620
When they're considering a
banking app, they might

538
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,790
consider other banking apps-
Paypal or Wells Fargo, but

539
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:33,790
once they've decided to get
the Bank of America app,

540
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:36,500
they're more likely to install
a complementary app, not a

541
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,720
supplementary app.

542
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,760
So here you see them installing
a trading app, such

543
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,050
as "Merill Edge," or another app
by the same developer the

544
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,170
BOFA Health app.

545
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:49,520
In the middle is an example of a
user looking to get a Bible.

546
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,720
Users looking to get a Bible
might consider the various

547
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,630
options, but once they get the
Bible, they'll get other

548
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,750
religious apps, not other
Bible apps, so it's

549
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,970
complementary to what they've
already gotten.

550
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:03,670
The third example is a widget
that helps users show the time

551
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,720
on their home screen.

552
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,260
They might consider "Digiclock"
or "Dashclock" but

553
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,760
once they instal the "Dashclock"
widget, they've

554
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,070
bought into that style, that
ecosystem, so then they're

555
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:15,890
more likely to install other
widgets or other add-ons that

556
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:18,520
have the same style, to have
the unified experience on

557
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,770
their Android device.

558
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:22,080

559
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,470
Last year at Google I/O we
launched Personalized

560
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:27,010
Recommendations.

561
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:29,480
As I said, these were on the
home screen of the Google Play

562
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,910
homepage and they've been
performing extremely well.

563
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:36,160
And with the new launch of
Google Play, we really decided

564
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,690
to double down on this and
start personalizing many

565
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,760
different parts of our system.

566
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,810
So I thought it's a good
opportunity for me to tell you

567
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:43,970
what really we look for.

568
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:47,530
We have over 80 signals not
just from Google Play, but

569
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,160
also from the rest of Google.

570
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,630
But some of our major signals
include apps that are

571
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:54,360
complementary and supplementary
to apps that

572
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,820
users installed in the past.

573
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:58,510
We look at apps that are popular
in the user's area.

574
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:01,860
We look at apps that are being
+1'd by a user's circles.

575
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,370
Apps that were reviewed
by a user's circles.

576
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,682
We also look at apps that are
developed by some of you, if

577
00:25:07,682 --> 00:25:10,960
the users are already showing
interest in your developer

578
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,610
account, by other apps by you.

579
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:16,770
So here are some recommendations
for three

580
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:17,670
different users.

581
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:19,790
You can see +1s by
people's friends.

582
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:22,310
You can see apps that are
similar to other things

583
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:25,270
they've bought, also apps that
are popular in their area.

584
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,860
So how does this manifest
itself?

585
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,290
So this is the homepage
that we envision.

586
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:34,380
This is going to start rolling
out to different users over

587
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,280
the coming months.

588
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,010
On the left, is my grandmother's
home page, that'

589
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:40,310
what she sees.

590
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:44,310
She grew up very close to
military quarters in India,

591
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,430
because my grandpa lived
in that area.

592
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:51,140
And she was very interested
in getting stuff done.

593
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,840
We call her the colonel
of the family.

594
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,960
So for her actually the tasklist
makes so much sense.

595
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,250
But growing up in a military
area also means that you play

596
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,210
a lot of cards.

597
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:04,480
She actually plays two to four
hours of card games a day.

598
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,740
It's ridiculous, I don't
know how she does it.

599
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,420
And so seeing the tablet
highlight apps for her, and

600
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,390
seeing the card game right
up there is really what's

601
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,520
relevant to her.

602
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,650
For me, I travel a lot, and so
on the tablet highlights

603
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,390
section not only do you see
Google Translate, which I

604
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:21,560
should get so that I can
communicate with people all

605
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,310
around the world.

606
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,650
But it also tells me why.

607
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,030
It tells me that my
friend Abinahm has

608
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:25,890
+1'd this app here.

609
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:29,120
He had a great experience, so
that helps me improve trust in

610
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,750
the system and get this app.

611
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:33,470

612
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:36,240
You can take this a step
further, on all four category

613
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,480
homepages both of these
are for me.

614
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,230
On the left, I live in San
Francisco, so you see the San

615
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,810
Francisco Giants app, you see
the Oakland Baseball app, you

616
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,860
see Sacramento Kings app,
on the right is

617
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,740
the news home page.

618
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,970
You see news apps and magazine
apps that are related to what

619
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:52,920
I bought in the past.

620
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:57,250
I have "Pulse" and people who
have "Pulse tend to also enjoy

621
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,840
"New York Times." It's amazing
to me that "Times of India"

622
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,980
comes on my personalized home
page, but it wouldn't on some

623
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,340
of yours just because my friends
tend come from that

624
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,280
part of the world, and they
say this is a great

625
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,630
app to adopt it.

626
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,760
How can we apply personalization
to search?

627
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,920
I've talked about using
location, so a user in Japan

628
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,590
will see different results for
Yahoo than a user in the US.

629
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:23,600
But we think categorical queries
are a place where we

630
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,370
can really help the user find
what they're looking for.

631
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:29,520
Imagine the user researches
for free games.

632
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,700
If we know that they like word
games, showing them free word

633
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,480
games makes a lot of sense.

634
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,750
If they like RPG games, showing
them those kind of

635
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:42,150
games is going to help get a
much faster acquisition rate.

636
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:46,200
For train schedules, a user in
New York should get the subway

637
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,060
train schedule, a user in San
Francisco should get either

638
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,490
the BART train schedule or
the Caltrain schedule.

639
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:52,540
It just makes sense.

640
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,390
And so over the coming months,
we're going to roll out more

641
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,210
experiments.

642
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:58,720
And, finally, to everybody,
personalization across

643
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,230
categorical searches.

644
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,820
So I've thrown a lot of
things at you so far.

645
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,910
So just to step back
and summarize it.

646
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:08,630
We've talked about the search
statistics, the feedback loops

647
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:11,400
that we look at in order to
improve our search and our

648
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,340
discovery systems.

649
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,970
We talked about navigational
search suggestions.

650
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:18,230
We talked about how our top
charts are generated across

651
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,550
each category , generated
daily and

652
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,810
across every country.

653
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:24,790
We talked about what trending
apps are, what it means to be

654
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,750
in there, and how you
can get in there.

655
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:29,700
We talked about how related
and cross sell works.

656
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,360
And we also talked about how
we're starting to personalize

657
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,300
Play and how that's going to
roll out over the coming

658
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,540
months, and how that really
fulfills our vision of a

659
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,580
personalized Play
made personal.

660
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:43,900
So I promised you, guys, I'll
leave you with five things

661
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,410
that you can do to improve your
discoverability on Play.

662
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:49,130
So let's get right into it, but
before we do that, I want

663
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:52,360
to tell you it's just as
important to build a good app.

664
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,520
To take the time to go through
those app developer guidelines

665
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,120
on developer.android.com and
make sure you have a good app.

666
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,770
You can complement that by
optimizing on the store, but

667
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:05,120
at the end of the day, nothing
substitutes a very good

668
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,790
experience for your app.

669
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:11,590
Two months ago we added
a list of guidelines.

670
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,470
The Tablet [? App ?]

671
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:15,570
Guidelines, what it means to
be designed for tablets.

672
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,580
And I highly recommend that you
get this design for tablet

673
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,870
designation.

674
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:22,840
Earlier at I/O we announced
the design for tablets top

675
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,330
lists on some of
our home pages.

676
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,820
Over time this is going to roll
across the Store, so a

677
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:32,890
tablet user really gets the best
experience possible by

678
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:35,550
showing the apps and promoting
the apps that have gone

679
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:38,670
through the trouble of making
that experience better.

680
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:41,150
So you're going to see this not
just on the top list, but

681
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:44,630
over time in search and
all of our other

682
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:46,350
discovery features as well.

683
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:49,090
The developer console helps
you with optimization tips

684
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:51,790
that they've added, and then in
the next talk by [? Ali ?]

685
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,150
[? Mausen ?]

686
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:54,670
[? Ricardo ?] we'll go through
this in detail-- what you can

687
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:57,340
do to really get some of
these designations.

688
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,540
So get the "Designed for
Tablet" designation

689
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:05,000
Number two, and this is a much
less known fact about the way

690
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,760
we do search ranking
at Google Play.

691
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,860
Today most articles that are
published on the web about

692
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:15,140
Play apps have a link at the
end that says Google Play

693
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,180
Store, or play link.

694
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,630
Actually over 99% of anchors
that we get into the Google

695
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:21,980
Play Store just have
those two phrases.

696
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,400
And that doesn't
help us at all.

697
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,155
We want to help you get
discovered even on Play.

698
00:30:26,155 --> 00:30:28,790
Sure, you tell us a little bit
about your app, but if a

699
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:31,260
trusted source on the right,
for example, TechCrunch, is

700
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,230
telling us what your
app is about.

701
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:37,170
Even before you have any
installs, we can trust that

702
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:39,080
and start boosting you
for those terms.

703
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:43,720
So next time you're talking to
a blog writer or someone

704
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,670
writing an article about your
app, have them give you some

705
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:47,120
link juice.

706
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,550
Have them put something
interesting in those links

707
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:52,330
linking to your app

708
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:55,040
The third one is to avoid
common mistakes.

709
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,850
I told you there were 6 million
and more unique

710
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:00,960
phrases that are searched
for every month.

711
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,550
What I didn't tell you is over
half of them are misspelled.

712
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:09,170
That's amazing that half the
people are mistyping queries,

713
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:12,290
but that's just how the query
stream is on mobile today.

714
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:14,850
So as Google what we have to do
is we have to aggressively

715
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:15,900
correct for it.

716
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,100
We have to make sure we help
the user find what they're

717
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,470
looking for, even
if it's a typo.

718
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:23,590
So the one thing you can learn
from this is don't name your

719
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:28,120
app something that is a cute but
a common misspelling of a

720
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,135
very popular app, because
chances are a user looking for

721
00:31:32,135 --> 00:31:34,040
your app will get autocorrected
into something

722
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,780
that you're not happy with.

723
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,740
The second thing I already
talked about, using the

724
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:42,600
targeting expressions on the
developer console carefully,

725
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,260
which countries and carriers
you're targeting depending on

726
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,430
your target audience.

727
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:50,180
And the third one, again, is one
that is a little subtle,

728
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,520
but I think it's important.

729
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:56,100
If you do have a developer URL
that is not a play.google.com

730
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,510
link or a code.google.com,
something that is

731
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,830
your home on the web.

732
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:02,590
If it exists, do make sure
you upload that in

733
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,640
the developer console.

734
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,200
Why?

735
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,020
Well, we crawl the web, we
index the web for our web

736
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:11,060
search, and we use a lot
of those signals in

737
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,270
order to help you.

738
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:15,110
If we know that you're the
kind of developer that is

739
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:18,390
about a specific subset of the
world, we will help you get

740
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:20,460
discovered when people are
looking for those terms on

741
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,000
Google Play.

742
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,150
So again, if you have a
developer URL other than

743
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:28,670
something at google.com,
do upload that.

744
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:30,580
Number four, is to make
your APK smaller.

745
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,230

746
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:36,770
Users tend to install smaller
apps, a lot more than they do

747
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:37,740
larger apps.

748
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,340
And they tend to uninstall
larger apps at a

749
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,040
higher rate as well.

750
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,670
Let's think about why.

751
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,120
As your phone runs
out of memory--

752
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,800
there's a finite amount
of memory--

753
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,640
users tend to go through the
list of apps they have, in

754
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,910
decreasing order of size, and
start uninstalling the apps

755
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:56,450
that they're using
least actively.

756
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:59,056
So the further down that list
you are, the less likely you

757
00:32:59,056 --> 00:33:00,970
are to be uninstalled.

758
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:03,640
So make your APK size smaller.

759
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,440
In the coming months we're going
to start looking deeper

760
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,530
into the APK from a search &
discovery perspective as well.

761
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:11,480
We're going to look at the kind
of SDKs you're linking

762
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,580
with, the libraries you're
linking with to figure out

763
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,370
what is your app really about.

764
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:18,460
Looking at the kind of sites
that your app is connecting

765
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,740
with by emulating it; and try
to really figure out what is

766
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:25,550
your app about, so we can help
users find apps that will help

767
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:28,680
them do what they're
looking to do.

768
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,740
And the last one--

769
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,400
and this is something many of
you asked us for-- is to

770
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,370
create a second channel of

771
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,790
distribution, the viral channel.

772
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:39,730
There hasn't been too much of a
viral channel, and I'm going

773
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:41,700
to go through a few things that
we're going to be pushing

774
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,810
over the coming months.

775
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:45,390
The first one are highly
rated apps.

776
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,980
These are apps that your
friends, your circles, and

777
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:51,380
others that you trust have rated
highly in our Store.

778
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,980
So here are some apps that
are rated highly for me.

779
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:57,760
On the right you see at the
"Quora" app is rated highly by

780
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,680
my roommate David.

781
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,090
He rated it five stars.

782
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:03,280
Then "Logo Quiz." my friend
Ruthica said it's an extremely

783
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,930
fun game, it's so addicting,
she couldn't stop.

784
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:09,239
That's the personal touch
that we can add to

785
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,480
the Google Play Store.

786
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,389
Some of these apps have never
been on the homepage.

787
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:16,830
This is the easiest way for each
of you to get on Google

788
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:17,940
Play's homepage.

789
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:21,210
Have your users review
your apps.

790
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:23,474
Their friends will start seeing
them on their Google

791
00:34:23,474 --> 00:34:25,929
Play homepage.

792
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:28,280
I've talked a lot about
+1 already.

793
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,940
+1 has been an integral part of
our system since we first

794
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,000
personalized recommendations
last year.

795
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,639
The reason I bring it up again
is because there's an API,

796
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,750
which I'm not sure why many
of you are not using.

797
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:43,850
This API is available on the
Google+ recommendations API

798
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:48,820
page and it enables you to allow
your users to +1 an app

799
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,060
from within your app.

800
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:53,389
So you don't have to have a
message that says go to Google

801
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:54,870
Play and +1 my app.

802
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:56,949
You don't need to have your
users leave your experience.

803
00:34:56,949 --> 00:34:58,310
Keep them in your app.

804
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:00,010
We want to make it easier.

805
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:02,465
So we already have in-app
billing for you guys, there's

806
00:35:02,465 --> 00:35:03,600
the in-app +1.

807
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,890
And in coming months we're going
to also have in-app rate

808
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:06,320
and review.

809
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,080
So again, we don't want your
users to leave your app.

810
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,250
If we can do what they need to
do from within your app,

811
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:15,040
great, and we're going to help
you do that as well.

812
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,210
And the last thing to create the
viral loop is to integrate

813
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:20,740
with Google Play
Games services.

814
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,940
At first, what you are going to
get is when someone opens

815
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,730
your app, they can see which of
their friends are playing,

816
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:26,960
they can find opponents--
it makes your app more

817
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,500
interactive.

818
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,970
You've got the multiplayer, you
have the leader boards--

819
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,650
it makes your app social.

820
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:34,275
In the longer term though, this
along with the Google

821
00:35:34,275 --> 00:35:38,010
Plus Moments API, which allows
you to share specific piece of

822
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:38,760
information.

823
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,220
I'm currently playing this game
or I'm at level 27 of

824
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:45,280
this game will allow us in the
Store to annotate and make

825
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,120
things more personal.

826
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:51,380
How great would be if my
homepage said, right now

827
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:51,840
[? Shellaby ?]

828
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,180
is looking for an opponent for
"Riptide." That's the best way

829
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,510
to not only get someone to
install your app, but open it

830
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,380
right away.

831
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:02,520
Get you those engaged users
that you're looking for.

832
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,990
So that's how I recommend
integrating with the Google

833
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:07,000
Play Games services.

834
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,570
Again, the five things that
you should do to get

835
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:10,630
discovered more in Play.

836
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:13,100
Get the Designed for Tablets
designation.

837
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,810
Start getting helpful web
anchors, avoid some of the

838
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:18,190
common mistakes about
misspellings, because we have

839
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:20,570
to auto correct for them,
and targeting

840
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,400
your audience correctly.

841
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,490
Reduce the size of your APK, and
then really start closing

842
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:27,680
that viral loop.

843
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,520
Help your users promote
you in addition to

844
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,420
depending on just the store.

845
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:37,260
So we've talked a lot about
user acquisition.

846
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:40,600
I've talked about the organic
growth that you can get from

847
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,160
the Search & Discovery aspects
of the Google Play Store.

848
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,940
We've talked about the viral
aspect of Search & Discovery,

849
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:49,420
and many of you already know
about the paid aspect, which

850
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:52,140
is important to some of your
businesses as well.

851
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,520
I won't talk too much about
it, but what I will say is

852
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:58,570
that investing in paid user
acquisition can have a very

853
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:02,210
positive impact on organic
and viral growth as well.

854
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:06,260
And so if you can, is it is
something to think about in

855
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,460
the bigger picture of things.

856
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:12,820
Now user acquisition is just
the first step in creating

857
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,600
lifetime value for your users.

858
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,350
As a business owner, I always
like to think about my key

859
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:20,340
metrics and have a very
good handle on them.

860
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:23,100
And the one that I found in the
mobile space and in any

861
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,740
user-centric space is the
lifetime value of

862
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,990
every one of my users.

863
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:29,140
We talked about user
acquisition, let me briefly

864
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,420
mention the other two.

865
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:33,970
User retention I like to break
into two different ratios.

866
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:37,040
The first is a short-term
user retention ratio.

867
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,270
This is how do I initially
keep my users?

868
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:44,910
Most of the time this happens
because the users like what

869
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,280
you're promising them.

870
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,030
They install your app,
they open it.

871
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,290
The long-term user retention
ratio, which is very much like

872
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:53,030
the long install metric that I
talked about, is the on-going

873
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,420
mechanics of your app.

874
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:59,590
Or what you develop, you
delivering on your promise.

875
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:02,050
So in the example of "Scramble
With Friends," initially they

876
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:06,070
got a lot of their users because
it was very much like

877
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,030
the word games when
[INAUDIBLE]

878
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:09,950
grew up with, but over time
their social, their

879
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:12,300
interactive features and what
kept them growing and made it

880
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,380
successful.

881
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,210
User monetization I look at
in terms of two different

882
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,920
lenses-- the big picture is the
revenue for install, and

883
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,650
that makes sense-- it's a very
good macro metric, and its

884
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:25,575
comparable to your user
acquisition costs, your cost

885
00:38:25,575 --> 00:38:27,130
per install as well.

886
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:27,920
So you can do that.

887
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,340
But the real picture is the
revenue per active user,

888
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,450
that's what you have most
control over-- the people that

889
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:36,750
are in your system, in your
game, in your app, and how can

890
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,440
you tune it to make
the most money.

891
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,750
So as you think about your
users, try and to break it

892
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,430
down into the key metrics
and have a very

893
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,010
good handle on them.

894
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:48,050
So I hope that this talk is held
to get a good idea of how

895
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:50,460
we build some of our Search
& Discovery systems.

896
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,480
My goal was to really start
this conversation.

897
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,120
I want to continue it.

898
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,690
And none of this would have been
possible without my team

899
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:58,860
on Google Play.

900
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,110
So this is my shout
out to them.

901
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:03,340
Thank you for doing all the
great stuff that you've done .

902
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,780
And for all of you, thank you
for being here so early.

903
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,540
I would like to continue
this conversation.

904
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:11,900
I'll be at office hours right
after this, so if you have any

905
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,100
questions, please come there.

906
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,020
Or you can reach out to me
on Google+ or Twitter.

907
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,670
And I'm happy to
continue this.

908
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:18,410
Thank you very much.

909
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:22,677
[APPLAUSE]
