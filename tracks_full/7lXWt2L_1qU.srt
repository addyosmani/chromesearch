00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,050

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,490
LOUIS GRAY: Welcome back to
Google Developers Live at I/O.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:09,980
Louis Gray here from
the Moscone

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,970
Center at San Francisco.

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,950
I've got Chris Lyon, hardware
engineer on the Chromebook

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,060
Pixel here with me,
as well as Andrew

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,450
Bowers, director of product.

8
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,270
So I'm really excited to have
you guys both onstage.

9
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,710
Thanks for joining me again.

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:22,790
CHRIS LYON: Thank you.

11
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:23,200
ANDREW BOWERS: Thank you.

12
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,200
LOUIS GRAY: Now, the Chromebook
Pixel, it's just

13
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,620
been one of the best devices
I've ever had.

14
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,390
Just straight out.

15
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,200
Chrome OS has really been
something that's really

16
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,280
intriguing to me for
a long time.

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,680
We've really enjoyed having
the ability to have all my

18
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,760
content in one place.

19
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,120
And you can switch from computer
to computer, and it

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,350
follows you.

21
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,370
But for the first time ever,
this is a device that was

22
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,770
completely designed in
hardware by Google.

23
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,570
So I wanted to talk to
you guys about that.

24
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,570
And talk me through that
process, in terms of how did

25
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:52,580
that happen?

26
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,960
And what were we trying
to achieve?

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,400
ANDREW BOWERS: Yeah.

28
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,110
So the first thing we were
trying to do is really just

29
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:02,350
create the best Chromebook
possible, no holds barred, and

30
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,530
really thinking about someone
who's using a Chromebook all

31
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:05,430
day long as well.

32
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,900
So a lot of focus, attention
to detail, on

33
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,970
how the device feels.

34
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,780
We really want the hardware
to disappear.

35
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,430
We want to make it feel like an
immersive movie, where you

36
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,910
forget that you're in a movie
theater and you're just really

37
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,130
focused on what you're doing.

38
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,460
And so part of that's making
that hardware disappear so you

39
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,320
don't feel the keyboard, the
trackpad, things like that.

40
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,280
LOUIS GRAY: Now, what are the
kind of attributes in hardware

41
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,420
that you were trying
to get to?

42
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,510
How did you decide whether it
had an 11-inch screen or a

43
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,950
15-inch screen?

44
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,380
What were the things where you
made a decision on that?

45
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,410
How do you go about deciding?

46
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,520
CHRIS LYON: So for those items,
when we were setting

47
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,890
out in the early design process,
we did a large number

48
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,270
of user studies on various
screen sizes, various

49
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,060
configurations, keyboard
placement, et cetera.

50
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,730
And a lot of those various
parameters all fit together to

51
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,470
give us the proper shape
of the laptop.

52
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,960
One of the early goals was
we definitely wanted an

53
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,370
absolutely full metal
enclosure.

54
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,800
It feels very nice hold,
really solid design.

55
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,070
But that comes with a lot of
additional challenges as to

56
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,480
how you fit all of the
other components

57
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,960
together inside the system.

58
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,800
LOUIS GRAY: OK.

59
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,620
And so when I look at this,
having tried the previous

60
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,690
Chromebook models that were
plastic, they'd come out.

61
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:11,810
They were very light.

62
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,270
This one has a stronger feel.

63
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,730
It's kind of more industrial.

64
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,970
And one of the things that's
happened as a result of

65
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,330
making, I guess, the ultimate
Chromebook is it's a little

66
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,080
bit more expensive than the
original Chromebook.

67
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,680
We've been looking at.

68
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,460
Samsung.

69
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,630
I've got three of those
at my house.

70
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,370
Got one for my wife.

71
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,200
Got one for myself.

72
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,380
Got two for my parents.

73
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,750
And they're all $249.

74
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,950
And obviously, the Pixel
is a different beast.

75
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,660
It's starting at, I think,
$1,249, and you basically got

76
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,020
a little bit more expensive.

77
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,530
So what was the thought
behind that?

78
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,240
Was that something where we
wanted to set it up kind of as

79
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,810
a reference model?

80
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,730
Or do we expect these to
be for the mass market?

81
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,710
CHRIS LYON: So Pixel should be
thought of as a halo device,

82
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,190
something where we really want
to showcase a large number of

83
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,830
new technologies that aren't
necessarily in the other

84
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,530
Chromebooks, but things that
we want developers to

85
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,930
experiment with--

86
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,730
things like the high pixel
density touchscreen, things

87
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:03,940
like keyboard backlight.

88
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,980
I'm not sure if you're
aware, but there's a

89
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,530
microphone array in here.

90
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,620
There's two up top
for beam forming.

91
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,330
There's noise cancellation.

92
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,130
There's the LTE.

93
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,790
This is the first Chromebook
with that.

94
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,060
And again, these are a number of
features where the hardware

95
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,350
has to lead the software
a bit.

96
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,460
We have to get the features out
there, build a critical

97
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,910
mass of users, and then
encourage the developers to

98
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,100
target those features.

99
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,070
LOUIS GRAY: You mentioned
the high screen density.

100
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,920
One thing about the Pixel is
that you shouldn't have to

101
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,870
ever see a pixel.

102
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,490
I mean, that's sort of what
we've been talking about.

103
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,170
You say Chrome.

104
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,320
You want to get the Chrome out
of the way, the browser, and

105
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,970
really have the user be directly
interfacing with

106
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,480
their data, with
their content.

107
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,790
I'm glad you mentioned LTE.

108
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,090
I'm actually on LTE right now.

109
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,440
The Wi-Fi at the conference has
been really exceptional.

110
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,290
It goes up.

111
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:49,980
It goes down.

112
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,800
There's a lot of people fighting
for attention, and

113
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,060
I've really cut through all
of that by getting on LTE.

114
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,630
And having it on this type of
a device has really been

115
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,590
exceptional.

116
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,190
And so when I look at the Pixel
specifically, there's

117
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,950
really those three things
that have set it apart--

118
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,450
the inclusion of the LTE, the
high density pixel screen, and

119
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,370
the touch aspect of it.

120
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,910
Now, touch is something you
traditionally accept with a

121
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,990
tablet or a mobile phone.

122
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,740
What was the thought process
behind having a touchscreen?

123
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,810
And how are we seeing users
behave with the touchscreen,

124
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,630
or possibly developers
coding for it?

125
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,350
ANDREW BOWERS: So I think that
you hit on it right there,

126
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,950
which is touchscreens
are becoming

127
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,580
pervasive in our lives.

128
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,800
So they're on your phone.

129
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,580
They're on tablets.

130
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,960
They're even on ATMs and
the gas station pumps.

131
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,010
And so if you look at children
interacting with a laptop,

132
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,850
they've probably used their
parents' phone or their

133
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,680
tablet, and so they're touching
the screen already.

134
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,140
And so it's just a very
intuitive way versus an

135
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,610
indirect on a trackpad
or a mouse.

136
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,620
And so we're seeing it become
more and more pervasive, and

137
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,640
we think of it as yet
another way to

138
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,040
interact with the computer.

139
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,070
It's not the only way you
interact with a laptop, but

140
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:53,620
it's another way.

141
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,560
So to give you an example, on
Tuesday I spent five hours on

142
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,600
a plane, a cramped seat.

143
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,470
But I could hold my Pixel like
this, and I could scroll and

144
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,190
archive email on the plane
much more easily.

145
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,120
LOUIS GRAY: The viewers at home
can't see your hands.

146
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,870
ANDREW BOWERS: That's
a good point.

147
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,990
So a lot of times, you'll find
you'll use something in a

148
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,580
different way.

149
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,810
Like for instance, when you're
cramped in on plane, using it

150
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,600
like this rather than having
to use the trackpad.

151
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,320
So it opens up new
opportunities.

152
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:21,520
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

153
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:21,730
Absolutely.

154
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,610
And I've seen that a lot.

155
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,290
There's one really cool thing
that you get the right screen

156
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,180
combination, you can rotate the
entire screen 90 degrees

157
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,930
or 180 degrees to be fixed.

158
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,160
And literally, you look at the
Chromebook right side up, even

159
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,690
if it's on its side, which
is kind of entertaining.

160
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,530
And so for a lot of people who
have like a vertical monitor,

161
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,530
I can see them possibly
extending out and having that

162
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,640
vertical monitor.

163
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,190
And the processor in here is
strong enough that they can

164
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,090
push all those pixels even in
that new configuration.

165
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,790
So I want to talk a little
bit about the speed.

166
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,865
This is obviously faster.

167
00:05:51,865 --> 00:05:52,980
It's faster.

168
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,830
It's brighter.

169
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,100
It's got a lot of attributes
to it.

170
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,600
So what about the speed?

171
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
How did that come into play?

172
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,560
CHRIS LYON: So we designed the
Pixel to be Chrome fast.

173
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,660
The idea here was hardware
should not get in the way of

174
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,710
the experience.

175
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,760
We wanted this to be able to
show off the browser and the

176
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,060
operating system as
well as possible.

177
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,480
This is an Intel
i5 CPU in here.

178
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,070
There's four gigabytes of RAM,
pretty standard other features

179
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,550
internally aside from that.

180
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:24,050
But it's more than
enough for web

181
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,860
applications, for HTML5 games.

182
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,640
And it should actually enable a
significant amount of future

183
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,500
development coming there.

184
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,710
One of the things we're really
excited about is HTML5 games

185
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:35,680
are becoming more and
more popular.

186
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,700
And actually, we're seeing
developers make use of the

187
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,700
touchscreen, of the
high PPI display.

188
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,490
And we're really hoping that
as we can build more of a

189
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,840
critical mass of systems out
there with those features that

190
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,940
people will be implementing
more and more higher end

191
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,640
applications.

192
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,110
So we really wanted to make
sure that it had the

193
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,550
horsepower under the
hood there to be

194
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,130
able to handle that.

195
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,115
ANDREW BOWERS: And just to
add to that real quick.

196
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,956
I think one of the ways we also
think about is not we

197
00:06:58,956 --> 00:07:01,460
don't want consumers to have to
think about what processor

198
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,860
do they have in the machine.

199
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,800
We just want it to be, is
it fast enough for what

200
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,090
I want it to do?

201
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,520
And so we want to get
to that world too.

202
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,170
LOUIS GRAY: And one of things
that I've experienced having

203
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,350
the touchscreen on the laptop
is you can have more of an

204
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,680
immersive experience, be
it with Maps or Photos.

205
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,070
There's something really
breathtaking about diving into

206
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,140
Google Maps or the Google+
Photos experience and just

207
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,710
being able to pinch to zoom
and getting right

208
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,380
into what you want.

209
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,870
And you just swipe to the side
and have it go away.

210
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,990
And it's something that's
really become natural.

211
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,280
It's one of those funny things
about having a glossy screen

212
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,750
that you touch all the time.

213
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,810
I was in the car the other day
making a quick web change--

214
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,690
I was on LTE-- and I
saw my fingerprints

215
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,830
all over the screen.

216
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,560
How do you guys handle just
managing that type of thing,

217
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,080
where you get a little bit dirty
and you clean it off?

218
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,670
So what do you think about
that kind of stuff?

219
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,140
ANDREW BOWERS: It's
called a cloth.

220
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,940
CHRIS LYON: It is actually a big
engineering challenge, and

221
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,210
it is something that we
put a fair amount of

222
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,430
work into with Pixel.

223
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,120
Obviously, there's still a
long ways to go in that

224
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,310
direction, and it's something
we're continuing to research.

225
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,320
LOUIS GRAY: Yeah, it's one
of those fun things.

226
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,490
And you don't realize how often
you touch it until you

227
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,739
get the little bit of glare, and
you're like wow, I touch

228
00:08:00,739 --> 00:08:01,760
this thing all the time.

229
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,930
You've got the hands on there.

230
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,300
CHRIS LYON: One of the nice
things though-- the screen is

231
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,620
Gorilla Glass coating,
just very resilient.

232
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,310
So at least even if you are
smudging it, you don't have to

233
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,090
worry about damaging it.

234
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,930
LOUIS GRAY: What I find is I
often am reaching to other

235
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,610
people's computers and expecting
that I can impact

236
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:17,310
the touchscreen.

237
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:17,940
And I'm like, are
you kidding me?

238
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,240
Why are you using
that product?

239
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,680
CHRIS LYON: Actually, that's
been an interesting problem in

240
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,110
the office.

241
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,950
So when we were using these
initially internally a lot,

242
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,920
people got in the habit of when
they'd written an email

243
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,110
then just pushing the Send or
the Compose button on there.

244
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,510
And you'd see people walking
around when this was still

245
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,700
secret and we couldn't have
them in every meeting.

246
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,299
And they'd have their ThinkPad
out, and they'd push the

247
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,059
screen, and they'd get mad.

248
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,110
LOUIS GRAY: Nothing
would happen.

249
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,010
CHRIS LYON: Definitely a number
of our vendors and

250
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,270
partners probably caught
on to that.

251
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,709
LOUIS GRAY: We have like five
minutes left, so I want to

252
00:08:43,709 --> 00:08:45,470
talk a little about Chrome OS.

253
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,690
Now, you know Chrome OS is still
a little bit new for a

254
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,980
lot of people, and it's really
kind of growing in maturity in

255
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,900
terms of the capability.

256
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,030
Every time Chrome gets better,
Chrome OS gets better.

257
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,580
And about two years ago-- maybe
it was even three at

258
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,440
this point-- with the Cr-48
model coming out, really kind

259
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,280
of the first reference
point of having a

260
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,570
Chrome device out there.

261
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,120
It wasn't super fast.

262
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,140
There were some aspects of the
hardware which were not

263
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,270
perfect, but it was a
fun reference point.

264
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,620
And since then, we've continued
to see iterations

265
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,725
from Chrome via devices from
Samsung, Lenovo, HP, Acer.

266
00:09:15,725 --> 00:09:17,240
I hope I've mentioned
them all.

267
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,450
And you've seen people come up
with different price points

268
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,520
and different sizes.

269
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,450
Now, what has been your kind of
response to see how Chrome

270
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,070
OS is evolving?

271
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,010
And what is left?

272
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,340
What is kind of the last things
that the Chrome OS

273
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,030
should be doing, where people
can really safely leave more

274
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:36,190
traditional operating systems?

275
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,960
ANDREW BOWERS: So the Samsung
Chromebook has been the number

276
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,540
one laptop on Amazon for about
190 days since its launch,

277
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,710
consecutively.

278
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:47,220
And so I think that speaks for
itself in terms of what people

279
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,530
are ready for.

280
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:51,600
With the Pixel, we've taken it
a step further as well in

281
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,140
terms of there are a lot of
people that wanted high-end

282
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,430
hardware, precision hardware.

283
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,720
They spend 10 hours a
day on a Chromebook.

284
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,540
And so when we say for everyone,
we don't just mean

285
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,580
people that want a very
affordable laptop, but also a

286
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,110
precision experience with a
great keyboard and trackpad

287
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:08,850
and touchscreen.

288
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,210
And so with the Pixel, we're
bringing that as well.

289
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,250
So you cover different
needs out there

290
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,280
for different people.

291
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,590
LOUIS GRAY: Sure.

292
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,510
And I think you're mentioning
that you say for everyone, but

293
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,650
it's also for everything.

294
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:22,320
As someone who's very Google
Drive-centric, with all of my

295
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,840
files and my applications there,
going to Gmail, going

296
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,800
to my Google+, I really believe
at this point every

297
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,770
computer is my computer.

298
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:30,850
So long as I can get
to my Google

299
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,160
content, it's all there.

300
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,320
But actually, I'd much rather
be using a Pixel.

301
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,250
If you handed me a ThinkPad,
I'd be fine.

302
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,530
I'd be able to boot up Chrome
and do all my work.

303
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,610
But with the Pixel, it just
has such kind of a

304
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,470
professional, high quality
experience.

305
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,640
You don't want to suffer the
screen display of something

306
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,610
else which isn't as strong.

307
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,880
And even just the little bits
with like the keys and the

308
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,130
hardware and the trackpad are
so professionally designed.

309
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,230
And so I think you can really
see that, for those people who

310
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,083
do get an opportunity to
get their hands on it

311
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,700
to check that out.

312
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,220
So for the many people who are
watching on the livestream,

313
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,386
how do they get their
hands on a Pixel?

314
00:11:02,386 --> 00:11:04,270
ANDREW BOWERS: So they can go
to the Google Play store

315
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:07,380
online or bestbuy.com as well.

316
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,670
LOUIS GRAY: And Best Buy
has them in display.

317
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,510
I remember that's actually
where I bought the three

318
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,820
Samsung Chromebooks
that I got.

319
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,360
I almost cleaned them out.

320
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,770
And I think I sold five other
ones in the 10 minutes I was

321
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,290
there just playing demo.

322
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,680
And so I think it's great that
you have the Pixels out there

323
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,410
getting really big
distribution.

324
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,490
Anything else that the viewers
should know about the Pixel

325
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,950
before we cut?

326
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,440
ANDREW BOWERS: I think that you
really have to experience

327
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,460
it to understand what it
is and what it means.

328
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,240
And I think it brings
Chromebooks to a whole other

329
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,095
level of user that want
to use Chromebooks.

330
00:11:39,095 --> 00:11:41,940
And so we hope that it'll open
up a lot of opportunities for

331
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,420
people to experience Chromebooks
and how easy they

332
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,586
are to use and how great it
is to live with them.

333
00:11:46,586 --> 00:11:48,370
LOUIS GRAY: Well, thank you
very much, both for you

334
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,600
joining me on stage and for
all the work that you did

335
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,110
putting into this product.

336
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,940
It's obviously something I use
every single day, not just at

337
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,470
the conference.

338
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,780
And I constantly run into
my kids saying, hey,

339
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,290
Daddy, look at that.

340
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,420
And they'll click on my
touchscreen and accidentally

341
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,900
click on an ad or something.

342
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,080
But they understand exactly
how to interface with a

343
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,560
touchscreen, because they've
been growing up with tablets.
