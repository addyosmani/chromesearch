00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:03,380
VISHAY NIHALANI: Hi, everyone.

3
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:04,900
Thanks for coming out today.

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,930
My name is Vishay Nihalani, and
I'm joined by Flo Thng.

5
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,850
Flo and I are both product
managers who work

6
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,600
at Google on AdMob.

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,260
So just by show of hands, how
many of you here are familiar

8
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,680
with AdMob?

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,670
And how many of you are
app developers?

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,160
Excellent.

11
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,790
And how many of you app
developers have actually

12
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,460
included AdMob in one of your
applications, either to

13
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,560
monetize, or used AdMob
to promote?

14
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,810
FLO THNG: Yeah!

15
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,440

16
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,150
VISHAY NIHALANI: Well, it's
great to see that so many of

17
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,500
you are active and
have used AdMob.

18
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,570
You guys are at the center of a

19
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,610
thriving mobile app ecosystem.

20
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,890
And we're really proud
to be part of that.

21
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,730
Every day we see that users are
downloading more and more

22
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,730
applications, and spending
more time in those

23
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,250
applications as well.

24
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,530
So at AdMob, our goal is to help
be a partner for you, and

25
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,940
help you promote and monetize
your application successfully.

26
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,580
The pace of growth
is absolutely

27
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,950
staggering with apps.

28
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,110
And no doubt, that growth
creates some interesting

29
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,970
challenges.

30
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,040
At AdMob we see three
major challenges.

31
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,210
These are around discovery,
monetization, and the user

32
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,950
experience.

33
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,780
There are now over 1.6 million
applications across the Google

34
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,360
Play and iOS app stores
combined.

35
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,080
That's great choice for users,
but what does that mean for

36
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,890
you as an app developer?

37
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,770
As an app developer, that
means that you have to

38
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,520
constantly jockey for place in
the marketplace rankings in

39
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,570
order to get your app in
front of your users.

40
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,010
So it's important to be
incredibly deliberate about

41
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,070
how you promote your
app to your users.

42
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:39,290

43
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,590
On the monetization side, as
your user base grows, you

44
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,520
expect your revenue
to grow with it.

45
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,870
And doing that might
involve working

46
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,240
with multiple ad networks.

47
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,240
But working with multiple
networks can be challenging,

48
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,650
both technically and
operationally.

49
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,150

50
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,170
And on the user experience side,
it's important to be

51
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:00,180
tactful about how you show
adds to your users.

52
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,900
A bad experience can ruin
the user's experience.

53
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,320
It can put off your existing
users from using your app, and

54
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,190
it can turn away new users
if they see bad

55
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,290
reviews in the app store.

56
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,240
And as a developer, you're
including content from third

57
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,470
party sources.

58
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,120
So you want to make sure that
the content that shows up in

59
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,660
your application enhances
your brand rather

60
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,040
than tarnishes it.

61
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,380
You want to make sure that the
ads that show up are relevant,

62
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,505
engaging, and appropriate
for your users.

63
00:02:26,505 --> 00:02:29,744

VISHAY NIHALANI: Just
this year--

[BREAK IN AUDIO]

67
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,250
VISHAY NIHALANI: This is just
the first step to opening the

68
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,900
floodgates of monetization.

69
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,700
And we hope to see tremendous
growth in this area.

70
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,930
And of course, we want to help
preserve the user experience.

71
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,410
We have a team at AdMob that's
working on building innovative

72
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,320
new ad formats that help
preserve the user's experience

73
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,810
within your application.

74
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,370
We're building ad formats that
inherently verify that the

75
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,450
user is actually interested in
the ad content before taking

76
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:32,760
them out of your app and
onto the landing page.

77
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,300
So with an eye toward solving
some of these challenges, I am

78
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,970
really excited to announce the
launch of a brand new AdMob.

79
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,080
This new AdMob is laser
focused on apps.

80
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,640
At the same time, we've brought
the power of AdSense

81
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,370
and AdWords to mobile apps.

82
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,330
We've leveraged more than a
decade of innovation and

83
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,630
experience to bring you the
scale and reliability that

84
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,350
Google offers across all
of its ads products.

85
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,510
Our goal is to make it
incredibly simple for you to

86
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,480
promote and monetize
your applications.

87
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,910

88
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,200
The idea is to make it very
simple for you to promote and

89
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,130
monetize so that you, as a lone
app developer with an

90
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:15,470
idea, can go to becoming a team
of app developers working

91
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,860
on building a sustainable
business like Chris in this

93
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,600
We hope that this will be a
familiar aspiration for many

94
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,850
of you in the audience.

00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:29,910
-Inspiration can come from some
pretty unlikely places.

98
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:33,100
But once it hits, there's
a lot of work to do.

99
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,010
Designing an app takes months
of programming, problem

100
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,410
solving, and testing.

101
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,890
But finally you have something
you're happy with.

102
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:44,930
And now, with AdMob, you can
earn a return on all your work

103
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,690
by showing relevant
ads in your app.

104
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:51,670
Then, with AdMob's promotion
tools, watch your app take off

105
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,950
in a bigger way than
you imagined.

106
00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:00,520
From success at home to
downloads online, AdMob

107
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,020
connects your app
with millions of

108
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,855
advertisers and users.

109
00:05:03,855 --> 00:05:06,660
So now that you're earning
money, you'll have more time

110
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,330
to build your business,
and get inspired for

111
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,805
your next great app.

VISHAY NIHALANI: And with that,
I'd like to introduce

115
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,160
Flo, who's going to talk about
some of the features that

116
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,746
we've built into the new AdMob
to improve app promotion.

117
00:05:25,746 --> 00:05:27,130
FLO THNG: All right.

118
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:27,770
Thanks, Vishay.

119
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:28,920
Hi, everyone.

120
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,010
You saw some flashes of the new
interface in the video.

121
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,810
Now let's dive into the demo so
we can share with you some

122
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,040
of the exciting features in the
new AdMob to help you get

123
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,600
more users and make more
money from your apps.

124
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,000
We redesigned the UI into
three core sections.

125
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,150
Home, Monetize, and Promote.

126
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,500
Home tab is basically
a dashboard.

127
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,960
We pulled together all your
stats in one place to help you

128
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,310
get an overview on how your app
business is performing.

129
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,780
On the top here, you can see a
summary on how much money I've

130
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,520
made from my apps today.

131
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,550
And how many downloads
that AdMob has

132
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,080
driven to all my apps.

133
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,270
When you scroll down, we can see
more granular stats, like

134
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,880
RPM, fill rate, conversion.

135
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,060
It's nice to see that we're
getting more and more

136
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,350
conversion here.

137
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:23,560
And the best part, my favorite,
is that we've

138
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,750
organized all of this by app, so
you can quickly review and

139
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,530
figure out the action needed.

140
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,520
For example, Line Up is getting

141
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,000
quite a number of users.

142
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,240
Maybe it's time for us to
start monetizing it.

143
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,480
Or Flooded here, which is
actually earning me quite a

144
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,470
bit of money.

145
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:46,000
So I could consider actually
promoting it even more.

146
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,820
Which brings us to
the Promote tab.

147
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,970
Promote tab is the hub for
advertising with AdMob.

148
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,420
One of the advantages
of advertising with

149
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,220
AdMob is our scale.

150
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,230
Because we work with app
developers worldwide, like

151
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:04,000
yourself, we have billions of
users in the AdMob network.

152
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,470
And we've designed it so that
you can create a campaign to

153
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:12,060
reach all of those users with
just a few simple steps.

154
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,360
So I'm going to create
a new campaign today.

155
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,430

156
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,860
And the first step is to
just pick a campaign

157
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,140
that I want to promote.

158
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,290
I see a lot of you enjoying your
Chrome Pixel, so I will,

159
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,390
in honor of that, promote
a Chrome app.

160
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:31,460
All you have to do is just type
it in, and you see that

161
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,050
we pull automatically from the
two major app stores the most

162
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,670
likely app that I
was looking for.

163
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,250
Which in this case
is Chrome Beta.

164
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,330
So I will just select it.

165
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,360
No need to put any package ID.

166
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,730
And you can do image
ad or text ad.

167
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,190
I didn't have time to create an
image ad, so I'm going to

168
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,120
go with text ad today.

169
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,040
Good thing is AdMob is going to
help me make this text ad

170
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,800
more engaging and informative.

171
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,900
So all I have to do is create
a campaign name, an ad name,

172
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,560
put a bit for a CPC.

173
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,220
So I will put in $0.08.

174
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,580
We pull in the destination
URL directly.

175
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,830
Save you some steps.

176
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:21,780

177
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:27,150
And the best part here is we can
preview what it looks like

178
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,570
in different formats.

179
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,890
In tablet, in phone.

180
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:36,190
And we've made this a lot more
informative and engaging for

181
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,840
the users, because you can see
now, there is that Chrome

182
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,320
logo, the review information,
the rating information.

183
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,920
The goal is to make this app
informative so that users will

184
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,420
click on it and then download.

185
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:51,380

186
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,800
The next step is figuring out
who do I want to target with

187
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,910
this promotion.

188
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:01,130
So, because this is I/O
specific, I might want to

189
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,215
target just people
in San Francisco.

190
00:09:03,215 --> 00:09:08,320

191
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,040
And each of these targeting
settings

192
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,770
is very easily editable.

193
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:16,980
AdMob also, because we're
connected to Google Play, will

194
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,450
know automatically that Chrome
Beta requires Android 4.0 and

195
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,750
up in order to run properly.

196
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,710
The OS setting is
correctly set.

197
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,770
This is only going to get
shown to users who are

198
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,035
eligible to download your app.

199
00:09:30,035 --> 00:09:34,500

200
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,630
Now I just need to set a daily
budget, name this.

201
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:41,940

202
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:45,750
And I've just create the
Chrome app promotion.

203
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:51,000
Now what I want to know is how
effective is this campaign?

204
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,560
How many users is it going
generate for me?

205
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,610
And how much are these
users going to be?

206
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,770
The good thing is we've
integrated conversion tracking

207
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,450
into the campaign
creation flow.

208
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:07,800
So if you are promoting an app,
all you have to do is hit

209
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,940
Confirm and Finish here,
and you're all

210
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,340
done for Android app.

211
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,690
Or if you happen to have
analytics data, and you know

212
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,610
what is the value for conversion
for your app, you

213
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,480
can put in this optional
value here.

214
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,730
I'm going to put $2.

215
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,220

216
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,840
And just with that, AdMob will
automatically start tracking

217
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,580
the users who have clicked on
your app and then download it.

218
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,050
For iOS, it is a little
bit more involved.

219
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,490
You will have to include a short
code snippet in your

220
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:44,030
app, which you can access from
the App Conversion tab.

221
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:47,220
If you click on Edit, this
nice little pencil here,

222
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,760
you'll be able to get
that snippet here.

223
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,210
And we've made it easy, because
you can just email it

224
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,515
to yourself.

225
00:10:53,515 --> 00:10:55,120
Which I'm going to skip now.

226
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,190

227
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,540
If you're an app developer,
and I'm sure many of you

228
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,200
actually have multiple apps,
not just one, you can jump

229
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,910
start your new app by
cross-promoting it to your

230
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,360
existing user base.

231
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,910
And AdMob allows you to do that
easily with house apps.

232
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:16,260
So when you create a new
campaign, you can also select

233
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,700
to create a house app.

234
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:24,030
For example, if I want to
promote the Chrome app here to

235
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:27,180
LabPixies users, I'm going to
just do the same thing.

236
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:38,910

237
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,270
All of these is the
same as before.

238
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:45,410
The one new step is we now
display all of the add units

239
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,510
that you have created
for your app.

240
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:54,250
So I'm going to select Color
Drips and Flooded, which means

241
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,590
that this Chrome promotion
is going to show

242
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,440
in these two games.

243
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,690
I save it.

244
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:05,340

245
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,260
And because this is house app,
and we're promoting this to

246
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,240
your own inventory, you don't
need to set a budget.

247
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,550
We can actually do
this for free.

248
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:15,090

249
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,160
Next is you just allocate
your inventory.

250
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,680
So don't forget to do
this so that your

251
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,930
campaign will start serving.

252
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,330
Once everything is set up--

253
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,880
I've set up house app campaign,
regular campaign--

254
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,570
you can monitor the performances
of all of these

255
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:30,310
campaigns through our reporting
setting, which is in

256
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,910
these All Apps table.

257
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:37,070
So I can easily see which one of
my apps is converting well,

258
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,360
how much it is costing me to
convert, and what is the cost

259
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,970
per conversion.

260
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,110
So this is really cool, because
I've set up conversion

261
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:46,280
tracking for all of this app,
I'll be able to know how much

262
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,950
it's costing me to
get somebody to

263
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,840
download a Chrome browser.

264
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,560
The next step is
to optimize it.

265
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,500
So if you click on any one of
these apps, you'll be able to

266
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,530
see that I've set up
multiple campaigns.

267
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,860
Some of them are doing better
than the others.

268
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:07,100
And I've set up multiple ads,
and some are converting better

269
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,380
than the others.

270
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,600
So I might want to actually
optimize.

271
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,830
And we allow inline editing, so
I can just go in here and

272
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,690
say, maybe I need to
actually bid higher

273
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,240
and get better users.

274
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,290
Or I can go to Campaign tab and
says, the second campaign

275
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,230
is doing really well.

276
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,925
I want to actually increase
the budget.

277
00:13:25,925 --> 00:13:29,120

278
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,130
This is all, however, quite
manual you have to actually go

279
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,280
in there, figure out which
one is doing well.

280
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,550
Maybe create your own model.

281
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,490
So today we're really excited
to announce a new feature in

282
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,950
AdMob, which is called
Conversion Optimizers.

283
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:46,370
Conversion Optimizers will allow
you to set the bid based

284
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,810
on a target cost per
acquisition.

285
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,660
Basically, you just tell AdMob
how much you're willing to pay

286
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,890
for users, and let us do
the heavy lifting.

287
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:57,160
We are going to look at your
conversion history.

288
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,050
So we look at your campaign,
which one is performing well.

289
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,760
And we look at a bunch
of other signals.

290
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,420
And we have very complex
model in the back end.

291
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,310
All of these so that we can
predict when an impression

292
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,940
comes out whether it's going to
be very valuable for you.

293
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,880
So we're going to bid
higher for it.

294
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,080
And then for the less valuable
click, we're going to bid

295
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,280
lower for it.

296
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,450
In order to do this,
you just have to

297
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,025
click Edit on the campaigns.

298
00:14:23,025 --> 00:14:28,903

299
00:14:28,903 --> 00:14:30,153
Oh, sorry.

300
00:14:30,153 --> 00:14:44,710

301
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,550
OK.

302
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,280
We're having some--

303
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,220
so when you click on the
campaign, these are--

304
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,430
we're having some
network problem.

305
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:57,300
But you should be able to
actually switch bidding from

306
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,520
bidding on CPC to bidding on--

307
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,750
I'm going to show it
to a different way.

308
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,000
Sorry.

309
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:15,640

310
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,450
This is what happens when
we run a live demo.

311
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,700
Quite exciting.

312
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:27,950

313
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,440
So you can see here, you will be
able to switch your bidding

314
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,930
option from focusing on clicks
to focusing on conversion.

315
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:38,110
You can put in a target cost
per acquisition here.

316
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,300
I'm putting in $1.08.

317
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,090
That's how much I'm willing to
pay to get a user on Chrome,

318
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,380
because my RPU is really,
really high.

319
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:47,830
I can put in a lower number and
actually reduce my cost

320
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:48,830
per acquisition.

321
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,960
Just keep in mind, that means
the number of downloads that

322
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,080
I'm going to get is
going to be lower.

323
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,330
If I had put in a larger number,
like $2, I will get a

324
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,580
lot more download.

325
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,580
What we recommend is actually
put in a conversion cost close

326
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,890
to what you have right now.

327
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:07,640
So Conversion Optimizer, it's
important to keep in mind,

328
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:12,910
it's not the same as a
guaranteed cost per install.

329
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,380
The result is going to vary.

330
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:17,240
However, most people who have
implemented it have seen

331
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,870
really great results.

332
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,890
So our early testers have
seen reduction in

333
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,930
conversion costs by 20%.

334
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:27,810
We work with Gree, one of the
game developers in Japan.

335
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,910
They implemented conversion
optimizers across multiple of

336
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:33,700
their campaign, and they were
able to reduce their cost of

337
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,820
user acquisition by 50%.

338
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,180
Basically the same budget, they
get twice as many users.

339
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,080
Who doesn't love that?

340
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,320
So with this, hopefully, all of
you now can create your own

341
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,790
app promotion campaign.

342
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:49,500
We strongly suggest when you
do that, set up conversion

343
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,300
tracking so you'll be able
to know how much it

344
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,630
costs to get a user.

345
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:55,770
And please try out Conversion
Optimizer so AdMob can help

346
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,220
you optimize your budget.

347
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,530
With that, I'll hand it back to
Vishay, who is going to go

348
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,610
through Monetization tab,
and help you make more

349
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:03,860
money with your app.

350
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:08,910

351
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,160
VISHAY NIHALANI: Thanks, Flo.

352
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,280

353
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,010
So now that you've promoted
your application, you've

354
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,050
gotten tons and tons
of downloads.

355
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:19,190
The next step is to consider
modernizing those users.

356
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,560
So I'll quickly walk you through
what it's like to set

357
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,579
up monetization in one
of your applications.

358
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:27,680
So let's say we want
to monetize the

359
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,720
same Chrome Beta app.

360
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,160

361
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,510
So first select the
application.

362
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:37,000
As you can see, one of the
changes from the legacy AdMob

363
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,500
to this new interface is that
your inventory is actually

364
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,560
organized by application.

365
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,030
This is great for you because
it adds organization.

366
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,260
But it's also great because
it allows us to run some

367
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,850
interesting quality models to
really optimize your apps,

368
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,150
rather than arbitrary
ad units.

369
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,700
So let's say we want to
set up an ad unit.

370
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,190
It's quite simple.

371
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,350
Let's say you have a banner
on the bottom screen.

372
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:02,490

373
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,190
You can create this ad unit, see
a nice preview of the ad

374
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,330
unit, save it.

375
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,960
And just like on the promote
side, you can easily email the

376
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,300
instructions on how to
integrate the ad

377
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,630
unit to your developer.

378
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:16,470

379
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,200
So once you've done that and
released your application,

380
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,850
you'll start to see revenue pour
into your application.

381
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,070
It's fairly simple.

382
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,760
Now, the thing to consider is
making sure that you're

383
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,340
showing the right ads
to the right users.

384
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,310
So with our new publisher
controls feature, we allow you

385
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:35,710
to very easily categorize all of
the ads that are showing up

386
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:39,920
in your application, and allow
or block them by category.

387
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,590
So as you can see in this
interface, we launched the

388
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,710
ability for you to sort your
ads into hundreds of

389
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:48,020
categories, so that you can
make sure that only

390
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,470
appropriate ads show
to your audience.

391
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,030
We also have the ability to
see how much revenue is

392
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:56,820
actually coming from each
category of ad, so that you

393
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,080
can make an intelligent decision
on the risks versus

394
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,490
rewards of blocking certain
categories.

395
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,960
Many of you also may have
a concern about showing

396
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,460
competitors' applications
advertisements in your app.

397
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,930
So with this new feature, we
allow you to actually block

398
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:14,630
ads by the landing page URL.

399
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,580
So for example, if you're Chrome
and you want to block--

400
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,040
let's use an arbitrary
example.

401
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,040
Let's say you want to block
a particular game.

402
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:29,770
You can grab the URL from the
iTunes or Google Play store,

403
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,950
drop it in here, and
click Block.

404
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,810
And we'll make sure that that
competitor's apps don't show

405
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:38,130
up in your application.

406
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:41,100
So now that you've set up your
publisher controls and your

407
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,650
filters, you may find your
inventory start to grow.

408
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,270
And in that case, you may want
to work with multiple ad

409
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,460
networks to monetize
your inventory.

410
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,620
So we've made it incredibly
simple to add multiple ad

411
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,960
networks to your ad source.

412
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,790
So assuming that you've dropped
the SDKs into your

413
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:59,630
application already, it's very
straightforward to add more ad

414
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,640
networks because each ad
unit, by default, is

415
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,360
configured for mediation.

416
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,850
So to do that, simply add
another ad network.

417
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:12,060
Let's say in this case we want
to add the AdMob eCPM Floor.

418
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:15,260

419
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,320
Click Save.

420
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,700
And essentially, the
way mediation--

421
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,970
[BREAK IN AUDIO]

422
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,550
VISHAY NIHALANI: --that
network doesn't

423
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,740
fill the add request.

424
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,860
We'll kick it down to the next
highest paying ad network, and

425
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:31,590
so on, in order to maximize your
revenue per impression.

426
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:34,520
So simply set up what you've
been getting paid

427
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,770
from each ad network.

428
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,180

429
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,930
And by default, we'll start
to optimize your revenue.

430
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:45,590

431
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,880
So we hope these features will
be incredibly useful for you

432
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,280
as you monetize and promote
your application.

433
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,850
Just to recap, we've kind of
launched five key improvements

434
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:54,890
in this new interface.

435
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,760
These are smarter app promotion
and conversion

436
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,320
optimizer, simplified
mediation, robust ad

437
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,830
filtering, intelligent
reporting, and some of you in

438
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:07,590
the audience may be really
excited to hear that for

439
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,040
developers who are outside of
the United States, we are

440
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:15,870
launching local currency
payments all over the world.

441
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,860
We hope that this will make it
easier for you guys to get

442
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,240
paid and to start spending
your money.

443
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,770
So with that, I'd like to show
you some of our really

444
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:26,940
exciting new app formats which
we believe are really

445
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,960
innovative and will really catch
your users' attention.

446
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,810

447
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:34,885
So the first--

448
00:21:34,885 --> 00:21:35,860
I often play this game.

449
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,570
It's called Line Up.

450
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:44,430
And the basic concept is to
clear all these blocks away.

451
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:47,530
I often play this game while I'm
kind of waiting in line at

452
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:50,630
the cafes at Google.

453
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,500
And so in between levels--
let's say I'm

454
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,830
done with this level.

455
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,080
I start a new game.

456
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,635

457
00:21:58,635 --> 00:22:01,415
I think we're having some
network connectivity issues.

458
00:22:01,415 --> 00:22:04,840

459
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,890
There we go.

460
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:08,640
And so just like with TrueView
on the web, we've introduced

461
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,070
TrueView on the mobile apps.

462
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:13,990
So in this particular case, in
between the levels, it's a

463
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,720
natural time to show an ad.

464
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,250
We can actually present this
video ad to the user.

465
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,950
They can watch the ad, see if
they're interested in it.

466
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:23,070
If they are, they can keep
watching the video.

467
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,310
In this case, I've
seen this ad.

468
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,540
It's pretty cool.

469
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,680
It's the Chrome ad from Paris.

470
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,170
It's pretty sweet.

471
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:32,015
But I've already seen it before,
so I want to skip it,

472
00:22:32,015 --> 00:22:33,820
and I want to get back
to playing this game.

473
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,480
So to do that, I just click the
Skip Ad button, and just

474
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,210
like that I'm back
in the game.

475
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:43,010
So we hope that ad formats like
this one will help to

476
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:46,390
preserve the user experience,
and also increase the

477
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:50,260
advertiser ROI, so that they're
only receiving clicks,

478
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,000
and they're only receiving
users who are actually

479
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,850
interested in the content
that they have on offer.

480
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,780

481
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,710
So with that, I'd like to show
you all the story of Toni

482
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,120
Fingerroos You might have heard
of him from the game

483
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,640
Hill Climb Racing.

484
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,580
In three months, working long
hours by himself, he built an

485
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,760
app that now has tens of
millions of downloads.

486
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,770
We believe our new platform
will help create many more

487
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,470
success stories just
like this one.

488
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:22,697

489
00:23:22,697 --> 00:23:23,680
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

490
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,160
-I like cars I built myself.

491
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,380
That's one of my hobbies.

492
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,458
I own this old Toyota Supra,
which we put the engine and

493
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:33,698
all that stuff into.

494
00:23:33,698 --> 00:23:37,120
I guess it's a little bit in me
that I want to do something

495
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,540
on my own, build things.

496
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,890
Even it's a game or a car.

497
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,190
My name is Toni Fingerroos.

498
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,640
I come from Oulu, Finland.

499
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,180
We have a start up there
called Fingersoft.

500
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,770
It creates mobile
games and apps.

501
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:52,270
After developing several years
for a PlayStation game that

502
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:55,050
was still unpublished, I just
wanted to see some results,

503
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:58,930
and get my work shown to people
around the world.

504
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:02,340
So I started working on Hill
Climb Racing alone.

505
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,380
I spent like three months
working on it,

506
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,545
about 16 hours a day.

507
00:24:07,545 --> 00:24:12,230
The character itself, it's
actually drawn by my fiance.

508
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:16,530
Hill Climb Racing has had over
60 million downloads.

509
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,250
That's quite a lot.

510
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,750
That's really started
generating revenue.

511
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:25,010
About 40% comes from
advertisements, and AdMob is

512
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,540
our cornerstone.

513
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,750
With AdMob you have several
different ways to show

514
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,730
advertisements.

515
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:33,470
So we place them on the bottom
of the screen, and during game

516
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,570
play we hide all the
apps so it doesn't

517
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,080
interrupt the user at all.

518
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,100
We have users all around
the world.

519
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,220
So we have to feel

520
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,950
advertisements in global scale.

521
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:45,310
And I think AdMob is doing
a really good job.

522
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,920
I got enough money from AdMob so
I could develop Fingersoft

523
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,920
applications and games
full time.

524
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,040
If I show it like this--

525
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,940
see?

526
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,820
-Yeah, that's great.

527
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,970
-This is office we started.

528
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,240
Just a room from my place.

529
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,570
You can see me there.

530
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,690
This is the new office.

531
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:03,080
There's the work stations.

532
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,885
That's the pool table.

533
00:25:04,885 --> 00:25:07,860
And then, of course, the Finnish
style sauna which we

534
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,190
can relax in and design new
products and ideas.

535
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:14,180
So have a few beers
and take it easy.

536
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,710
I think it's awesome when you
get to create something, and

537
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:19,810
you get it finished, and then
you receive customer feedback.

538
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,520
And if they like it,
it's really nice.

539
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,550
And people like it,
and we like it.

540
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:28,092
That's great.

541
00:25:28,092 --> 00:25:33,080
[VIDEO PLAYBACK ENDS]

542
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,830
VISHAY NIHALANI: So I hope you
guys are all as excited to

543
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:37,290
access the new AdMob as
I am to share it.

544
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:40,050
We'll be rolling out this new
interface to new users.

545
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:42,310
And if you have an existing
account, be on the lookout for

546
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,420
an upgrade notification.

547
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,440
You can upgrade to the new
AdMob without making any

548
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,080
changes to your existing
application.

549
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,870
So you don't have
to go through an

550
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:51,280
extensive release process.

551
00:25:51,280 --> 00:26:03,965
And with that, we'll turn it
over to Q&A. Go ahead.

552
00:26:03,965 --> 00:26:05,440
I think there's a mic there.

553
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,090

554
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:11,630
AUDIENCE: While we're waiting,
just real quick one.

555
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:14,705
If you're just totally
new to ads--

556
00:26:14,705 --> 00:26:17,005
you've been a developer for a
while, but totally new to the

557
00:26:17,005 --> 00:26:20,220
whole ad world, what's a good
resource just to kind of start

558
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,600
to understand what CPM and
all that stuff means?

559
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,430
VISHAY NIHALANI: We
have extensive

560
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,510
documentation on our website.

561
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:30,420
I can point to the support
site offline.

562
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:33,490

563
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:36,220
AUDIENCE: My question is
more on the video.

564
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,260
So the interstitched video ads
between say a click and

565
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:44,300
something else that's coming
next, like you showed there.

566
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,620
Is there a way that
kind of works?

567
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,660
Maybe this is more of a
double-click question, but can

568
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,880
you run your own video
ads within that?

569
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,060
Is there a way to control that
inventory, or is that all

570
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,540
sourced inventory
from AdWords--

571
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,270
or what you guys are doing.

572
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,260
VISHAY NIHALANI: So today, all
the inventories source from

573
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:05,350
AdWords and the YouTube
network.

574
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,750
But we're working on ways to
kind of improve our house ads

575
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,350
functionality to allow you to
serve your own video ads into

576
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,950
applications as well.

577
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,200
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

578
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,680

579
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,300
AUDIENCE: My question is about,
you mentioned that

580
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:22,240
you're enabling payments in
local currencies, in quite a

581
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,485
number of countries.

582
00:27:23,485 --> 00:27:25,950
I'm interested in knowing
what countries they

583
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,740
are covering in Africa.

584
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,940
VISHAY NIHALANI: That's
a great question.

585
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,930
We have a huge list.

586
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:31,840
I don't know it off the top my
head, but I can certainly

587
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,170
point you to the resources.

588
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:36,820
We are launching local currency
payments just all

589
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,430
over the world.

590
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:41,190
So we'll definitely
let you know if

591
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,440
your country is supported.

592
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,000

593
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,570
AUDIENCE: I have a question
regarding

594
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,840
the convention tracking.

595
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,100
Let's say when I'm an
advertiser, and I want to

596
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,180
advertise at AdMob,
but I'm also

597
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,780
advertising in other ad networks.

598
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:58,200
So how well does the new AdMob
work with like third parties

599
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,320
for conversion tracking, and
all these kind of things?

600
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,772
FLO THNG: So if I get the
question correctly, does the

601
00:28:04,772 --> 00:28:07,900
new AdMob support conversion
tracking with other networks?

602
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,520
Is that the question?

603
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,065
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so when
I want [INAUDIBLE]

604
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:13,830
AdMob, if I can use third party
tools for conversion

605
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:17,080
trends so I can integrate, or
if I can use AdMob to also

606
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,410
track the conversions
from other networks.

607
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,630
FLO THNG: That's a
great question.

608
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:22,920
So for now, we only support
tracking conversion

609
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,810
tracking for AdMob.

610
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:27,930
And the URL conversion tracking
with third party URL,

611
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:30,030
we're going to support very
quickly after launch.

612
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:33,430
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

613
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:33,810
AUDIENCE: Hi.

614
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:35,590
I have a question regarding
the filters.

615
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:38,750
Is it possible to use wild
cards to block certain

616
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:42,260
keywords, or does it have
to be that exact URL?

617
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:45,820
Just in case that URL changes
on the other end from the

618
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,880
advertiser.

619
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,950
VISHAY NIHALANI: That's
a great question .

620
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:53,130
For now, we don't support just
filtering by keywords.

621
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,560
But the URLs are pretty--

622
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,350
we use regular expressions to
kind of match patterns.

623
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:00,570
So if you put in a regex,
it should work.

624
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:03,060
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

625
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:03,252
AUDIENCE: Hi.

626
00:29:03,252 --> 00:29:06,160
So I'm pretty interested
in the video ad.

627
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:11,020
So if you just skip the video
in like the five seconds, so

628
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,945
that's not counted as
a valid ad, right?

629
00:29:14,945 --> 00:29:18,040
So you don't have to
pay for that, or--

630
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,680
VISHAY NIHALANI:
That's correct.

631
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,140
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

632
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:23,490
And another question is that the
in cost marketing, so we

633
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:26,850
should be in the same AdMob
account, right?

634
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:31,670
So if I want to do the inhouse
ad, so we should in--

635
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,520
FLO THNG: Yes, house ad will
be in the same account.

636
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:33,840
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

637
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:43,146
But sometimes in our firms,
so each person has

638
00:29:43,146 --> 00:29:45,520
his very own account.

639
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,990
How do you solve a problem
like that?

640
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,210
FLO THNG: That's a
good question.

641
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:53,310
If you stop by the Sandbox
later, I'll actually just

642
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,560
address that with you.

643
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,810
AUDIENCE: All right, thanks.

644
00:29:55,810 --> 00:30:05,920

645
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,310
VISHAY NIHALANI: Cool.

646
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,690
Well, thanks, everyone,
for coming out.

647
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:08,070
FLO THNG: Wait, I think there's
one more question.

648
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:10,980
VISHAY NIHALANI: Oh,
one more question.

649
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:16,060
AUDIENCE: Is there possible to
insert animated ad banner?

650
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,850
FLO THNG: Yes, animated banner
will be supported.

651
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:21,630

652
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,620
AUDIENCE: Which format?

653
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:28,750
For example, can is insert
the Flash ad?

654
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,610
FLO THNG: I can get
back to you.

655
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,420
I don't think-- it's just
a regular format.

656
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,384
I don't think Flash will be.

657
00:30:33,384 --> 00:30:40,160

658
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,580
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

659
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,495
Do you have any sort of
recommendations on different

660
00:30:42,495 --> 00:30:43,150
ad formats?

661
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:47,080
So between banners,
interstitials, what performs

662
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,220
the best for different
types of apps?

663
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:53,290
VISHAY NIHALANI: Yeah, that's
a great question.

664
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:56,150
I think there are a couple
things to keep in mind.

665
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:58,530
Typically, you want keep the ad
placements in places where

666
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:59,550
it makes sense for your users.

667
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:01,860
So for example, if you're
playing with a game, as you

668
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,260
saw from Toni's video, you want
to keep the ad in a way

669
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,920
that it's not going to interfere
with the experience.

670
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:13,460
So in his example, he's kind of
got it on the menu screens.

671
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,450
For different apps, different
things work.

672
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:18,070
We typically find that
interstitials have higher

673
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,000
conversion rates and
clickthrough rates, just

674
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,310
because there's more
of a canvas to

675
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:25,320
create an engaging ad.

676
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,840
But it really depends
on the applications.

677
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,675
So definitely play around
and experiment.

678
00:31:28,675 --> 00:31:33,020

679
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:33,280
AUDIENCE: OK.

680
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,530
Hi.

681
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:37,670
I'm not really avid with AdMob,
but I have a question

682
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:43,560
about offline application
and your AdMob.

683
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:47,430
We have a connection for the
people who don't have Wi-Fi or

684
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,850
a connection.

685
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:49,630
What happens--

686
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:52,450
can you explain it
a little bit?

687
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:52,840
VISHAY NIHALANI: Yeah.

688
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,830
So that's a great question.

689
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:57,080
We've heard this feature request
a number of times.

690
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,540
We have nothing to announce just
yet, but we're certainly

691
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:02,007
kind of thinking about
this use case.

692
00:32:02,007 --> 00:32:03,170
AUDIENCE: OK.

693
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:04,420
Thank you.

694
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,780

695
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,100
AUDIENCE: Hi.

696
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:12,076
I'm curious about whether this
system is compatible with

697
00:32:12,076 --> 00:32:15,420
these new regulations that are
coming into effect in July,

698
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:20,770
related to advertising to
children under the age of 13.

699
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:24,270
Or whether you have, in fact,
terms of service that would

700
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:27,450
say you can't use this
system with children

701
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:29,610
under the age of 13.

702
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:33,430
C-O-P-P-A, COPPA regulation.

703
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,230
VISHAY NIHALANI: That's
a great question.

704
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:36,078
I'll have to follow up with
you offline on that one.

705
00:32:36,078 --> 00:32:38,890

706
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:43,810
In general, we always keep the
user experience at the

707
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,290
forefront of what we do.

708
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,740
We want to make sure that we're
compliant with all of

709
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:50,640
the sort of legal regulations.

710
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,150
And just kind of keeping
users in mind as we

711
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,400
develop these ads.

712
00:32:53,400 --> 00:33:01,700

713
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:01,925
Cool.

714
00:33:01,925 --> 00:33:03,120
Well, thanks a lot
for coming out.

715
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,330
Definitely come and visit
us at the I/O booth

716
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,810
we have just outside.

717
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:09,660
And we're happy to answer any
more questions you might have.

718
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,910
Thanks.

719
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:11,297
