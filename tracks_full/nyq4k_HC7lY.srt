1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,300

2
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,770
MEGAN SMITH: SO now we're
going to start into the

3
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,680
lightning talks, and
I have the honor of

4
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,490
introducing Susan Wojcicki.

5
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,330
Susan has been at Google since
the start-- she's actually our

6
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,400
first landlord, and I hope
she's going to tell you a

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,110
little bit about that.

8
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,460
But Susan is our senior vice
president of advertising, and

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,790
she really runs all the products
that make all of the

10
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,420
money that allow us to do all
the amazing things that we're

11
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,390
able to do.

12
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,580
She's an extraordinary
executive, an extraordinary

13
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,100
visionary, a strategic leader.

14
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,110
One of my favorites-- just a
personal story-- my favorite

15
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,780
experiences are--

16
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,400
Susan is always like double
and triple booked, and she

17
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,370
adds a lot of value, so
we get her everywhere.

18
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,030
And often if you're in a meeting
and there's a lot of

19
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,750
people debating ideas, and ideas
are flying around, but

20
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,380
you can't really get moving,
when Susan walks in the room,

21
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,970
it just changes.

22
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,380
Within five minutes, people are
focused on a screen and

23
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,240
kind of narrowing in on where
we're going to go.

24
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,820
She just knows how to lead,
she knows how to see the

25
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,470
future, and she's an
extraordinary leader of Google

26
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,190
and of our industry,
and I welcome Susan

27
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,440
Wojcicki to the stage.

28
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:10,340

29
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,440
SUSAN WOJCICKI: So good
evening, everyone.

30
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,130
It's really great to see such
a wonderful turnout

31
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,160
for our talk here.

32
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,110
And since this is a developer
conference, I thought I would

33
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,350
talk about a few key principles
that we use when

34
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,640
we're developing Google
products.

35
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,520
And I've been involved for
a long time in a lot of

36
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,240
products, so I summarized
this down to two.

37
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,040
But before I do that, I'm going
to talk a little bit

38
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,030
about my personal story.

39
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,510
And since Megan talked about me
being a landlord, I thought

40
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,780
I would start there.

41
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,290
So when people ask the question,
well how did you

42
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,100
decide to join Google?

43
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,170
I sometimes have to say, well,
my story's kind of unusual,

44
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,920
it's not really like everybody
else's story.

45
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,700
Google actually--

46
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,650
I actually lived with
the company,

47
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,630
Google, for five months.

48
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,640
And I don't think really anyone
else can say that,

49
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,050
except for my husband.

50
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:10,389
And so what happened was I was
renting rooms in my house, and

51
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:12,260
so, again, Larry had just
gotten funded for their

52
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,780
company and they were looking
for space, and I was looking

53
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:23,820
for renters, and we agreed on an
amount, and they moved in.

54
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,430
And at first I didn't really
think that much about it,

55
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,800
other than they were renters.

56
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,020
But then people would read about
it, and then they would

57
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,170
ask me questions.

58
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,050
And I would say, oh yeah, I know
them, they're actually

59
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,300
renting in my garage.

60
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,750

61
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,640
And so I started using the
products, and you have

62
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,240
remember there were a lot of big
competitors out there that

63
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,750
were much, much bigger than this
little company of three

64
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,000
people, at the time.

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,480

66
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,600
So I started using the product
and it was pretty good.

67
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,880
And I had this realization at
one moment, because the site

68
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,600
actually went down.

69
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,620
The servers were still running
at Stanford, and it was at

70
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,680
that moment that I couldn't
reach Google, and that's when

71
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,710
I really realized how important
it had become to me

72
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:17,930
in my life, and I realized the
potential for the world, and

73
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,300
that's when I decided I really
wanted to join Google and be a

74
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,200
part of that future.

75
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,110
So that's my story, in terms
of why I joined Google.

76
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:30,320
So I joined, and I was there for
one day, and Sergey comes

77
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:36,300
up to me and says, I have
a mission for us.

78
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,380
It's to organize the world's
information to make it

79
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,770
universally accessible
and useful.

80
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,430
What do you think?

81
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,000
I said, well, I was
in [INAUDIBLE].

82
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,080
So there are less than
20 of us here.

83
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,740
And you guys all just graduated
from college.

84
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,030
So that's a pretty ambitious
goal, right there.

85
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,730
But that brings me to my first
point which is that do

86
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:05,680
something important, think big,
and have a big goal of

87
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,430
how you can change the world.

88
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,230
And I was really pleased to see
that Larry talked about

89
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,450
that this morning in his
keynote, where he said that

90
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,089
there's so many things that
haven't been done yet, it's

91
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,959
important to focus on the great
things that haven't

92
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,360
happened yet.

93
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,480
And that's really a focus
that we have in

94
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,840
our development process.

95
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,530
And a lot of times, doing
big, ambitious things

96
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,960
sounds really hard.

97
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,650
In fact, they sound crazy, and
they sound impossible.

98
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,110
But when you break them down
into parts, a lot of times you

99
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,270
can realize they're
actually doable.

100
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,600
And doing really hard, crazy
things also has the advantage

101
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,020
that it's a lot less
competitive, because there are

102
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,050
fewer people who want
to do crazy things.

103
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,515
Like you.

104
00:04:46,515 --> 00:04:48,350
So let me give a few stories.

105
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:51,320
So let me start with
Street View.

106
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:57,020
So we have the beautiful imagery
that comes from the

107
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,160
Bright Angel Trail in the Grand
Canyon that we have been

108
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,760
working on.

109
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,130
In fact, here in the lobby you
can actually see the camera

110
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,320
that has created it, and you
can actually try on the

111
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,760
backpack, and walk around
and see how we did it.

112
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,680
But when I first heard about
Street View, it was just the

113
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,000
idea, which is let's create a
way to take pictures of all

114
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,110
the streets in the
whole world.

115
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,950
Right?

116
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,250
And I went, OK.

117
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,460
And then, you think about it,
and these ideas sound crazy at

118
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,220
first, but then you start
thinking, how

119
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,310
would you do that?

120
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,500
And you start thinking, well,
you would have cars, and they

121
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,394
would have cameras, or you could
have people, and they

122
00:05:36,394 --> 00:05:38,020
would have cameras, and then you
start talking, well, what

123
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,680
kind of cameras?

124
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,330
And then you find people who
actually really want to do

125
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:45,060
that, and then you're on your
way to making it happen.

126
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,820
So we just launched our 50th
country with Street View, and

127
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,520
five million miles of
Street View imagery.

128
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,730
So from a very simple idea, we
have something that enables

129
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,254
people to see imagery from
all over the world.

130
00:05:59,254 --> 00:06:00,504
Which is amazing.

131
00:06:00,504 --> 00:06:05,720

132
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,120
So going on to the next big
idea, which we are still

133
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,540
working on, which are
driverless cars.

134
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,220
Now, if you think about
driverless cars, and you hear

135
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,040
about this idea, it also sounds
like this giant idea,

136
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,890
is it really going
to get done?

137
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,410
Are we actually going to
be able to do this?

138
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,940
And if so, when?

139
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,630
And so, there are many,
many benefits.

140
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,690
It's probably the most dangerous
thing we all do, but

141
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,870
yet we have to do it,
which is drive.

142
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,735
And you think about the benefits
of saving lives, and

143
00:06:35,735 --> 00:06:39,020
emissions, and it really
could make a

144
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,870
difference in the world.

145
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,740
So my goal is to have the
people at Google do this

146
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,910
before my kids start driving.

147
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,150
So I have a personal OKR here.

148
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,510
But it's just an example of a
really big idea that doesn't

149
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,520
sound possible that you
can make have happen.

150
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,090
So let me move on to the second
big principle that we

151
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,090
think about.

152
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:01,950
Now, when I'm working with teams
and they are telling me

153
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:05,300
they're going to create some new
product, or they have some

154
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,320
idea, and they want to staff it,
and they want to build it,

155
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,750
I ask them, what is
your insight?

156
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,160
Tell me something why you're
doing something new, why

157
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,210
you've observed something in
the world that's different,

158
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,330
and what's your insight that's
going to make this product be

159
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,570
a big success?

160
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,170
And I found that if they can
answer that, the product's

161
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,370
usually a success.

162
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,090
And if they can't, then it's
often time to go back to the

163
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,420
drawing board.

164
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:35,020
And I think about the insights
as because there's so much

165
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,230
technology, and the world that
we live in is changing so

166
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,360
much, if we go around and we
look really, really carefully

167
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,830
at how the world's changing,
and we see new technology,

168
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:47,350
sometimes we can see glimpses
of how the world will change

169
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,840
in the future.

170
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,580
And if we can see that glimpse,
then we can build

171
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,750
around it, and we can plan for
it, and we can build those

172
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,630
next generation solutions,
we can build that future.

173
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:02,410
So I'm going to give a few
examples, actually, of

174
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:06,320
insights that have been really
important to me and my product

175
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,220
development, and that
have guided me.

176
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,550
And again, a lot of times these
are just one sentence,

177
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:14,230
but they're powerful because
it's a nugget that you can use

178
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,990
to build your products.

179
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:19,450
So I was working on
Google Video--

180
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,160
and as you can see, we have
the YouTube logo here--

181
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,920
and when I was working on Google
Video, we were working

182
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,890
with studios who had great
content, and we were working

183
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:33,190
to bring this online.

184
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:36,710
But at the same time, after we
had just gotten it online, and

185
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,580
users are starting to be able
to see it, we had this other

186
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,440
video that became very,
very popular.

187
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,480
In fact, it became--

188
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,080
the numbers were significantly
larger than what we were

189
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,790
seeing from the studio in the
studio deal we had done.

190
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,830
And it made me realize
the power of

191
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,950
user-generated content.

192
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,490
So do you guys want
to see that video?

193
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,060
Yes?

194
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,130
All right, let me show you a
few, just 15 seconds of it.

195
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,390
But it was this video that
really gave me that insight

196
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,640
and that inspiration.

197
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:13,390

198
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,610
What I love about that video is
that the roommate is doing

199
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,710
his homework in the background
the entire

200
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,580
time, and doesn't notice.

201
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,500
But this was an insight.

202
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,870
I realized, wow, this
user-generated content, it can

203
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,640
be really, really powerful.

204
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,900
And today we all know that,
because that's what the world

205
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,220
has become, user-generated
content.

206
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,060
It has its place, it's
very valuable.

207
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,720
There's also all kinds of other
content that's produced

208
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,380
professionally that's really,
really important to the

209
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,970
ecosystem, too.

210
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:41,500
But it was that video that
really gave me the confidence

211
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,440
in thinking that we should
acquire YouTube.

212
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,810
And I was a big advocate
of it, and

213
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,880
Google spent $1.65 billion.

214
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,490
So sometimes you have one little
insight, and from that

215
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,780
little insight, you make
a really big decision.

216
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,120
So I want to talk about another
insight that's near

217
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,940
and dear to my heart,
which is ads.

218
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,690
I'm responsible for Google's
ads business.

219
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:09,730
Now, we created an ad system
when Google had not very many

220
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,200
people at the company--

221
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,160
I would say probably like 30
people at the company.

222
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,660
And we didn't really have enough
people even to build a

223
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,470
search engine, let alone to
try to build an ad system

224
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:24,710
where nobody knew anything about
advertising, nothing.

225
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,880
None of us had ever
worked in it.

226
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,060
But we had an insight, and that
insight is something that

227
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,910
I still use today when
I think about the ad

228
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,430
products that we build.

229
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:37,220
And the insight's very basic,
but it's ads are information.

230
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,450
Now, if you think about ads
being information, and you

231
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:45,510
think about them just being
commercial information, then

232
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,050
the ads need to be relevant, and
the ads need to be useful,

233
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,680
the ads need to be shown
to the right person

234
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,580
at the right time.

235
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,970
Just like we think about that
first search result.

236
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,390
And so that meant we had to
build our own ad system.

237
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:58,060
That meant that if you typed in
flowers, you had to see ads

238
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,440
about flowers.

239
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,800
That if you typed in the name
of any book, all the ads had

240
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,990
to be about the book.

241
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,890
Not just for a bookstore, but
for that actual book.

242
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,560
And so that's a principle that
we use that caused us to build

243
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,660
an ad system.

244
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,530
And if I think about things
today, sometimes I'll get

245
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,760
questions, like when we first
went into display, people

246
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,170
would ask me how do you
feel about image ads?

247
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,050
How do you feel about
video ads?

248
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:26,030
Do you think an image ad
could not be a good ad?

249
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:26,980
You think about that.

250
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,260
Well, an image is information.

251
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,110
Are images useful to you?

252
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:33,110
Yes, then an image ad can be
useful provided it's served at

253
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,760
the right ad, at the right
time, to the right user.

254
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,150
All of it, at the end of the
day, is about serving right ad

255
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,820
and making it useful.

256
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:44,930
So that's an insight that
we've used across our ad

257
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,400
business, from beginning
till present.

258
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,680
And just going forward, moving
really quickly to the present,

259
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,520
if you look at today, and you
say, well, what do you see

260
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,020
about today?

261
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,280
What are things that
you're focused on?

262
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,670
I would say, we have
to be thinking a

263
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,910
lot more about location.

264
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:01,420
We have all these phones, the
phones know where we are, how

265
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,100
do we make all the services
that we have

266
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,700
super relevant to us?

267
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,560
So you think about all of you
having traveled, probably come

268
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,550
from all different places, and
staying in hotels, and looking

269
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,290
for places to eat.

270
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,700
Now, how many of you have
actually gotten some kind of

271
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,100
offer related to where you
are right now that would

272
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,820
be useful to you?

273
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,540
I'm looking, but I
see a few people.

274
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,970
They are the brave souls who--

275
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,470
or the people who have special
technology, or

276
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,710
have special insights.

277
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,280
But it's something that doesn't
really happen yet, but

278
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,880
there's no reason it shouldn't
and couldn't.

279
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,210
We should all be getting useful
information based on

280
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,910
where we are right now.

281
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,800
And the reason we haven't, is
just because those systems

282
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,780
haven't been built out yet.

283
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,780
This so it's just an example
of an insight in the way we

284
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,450
should think about things
in the future.

285
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:51,330
So just to sum up, those are my
two insights, that's how we

286
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,390
think about building.

287
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,430
We think about doing things are
really important, things

288
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,230
that haven't been done yet,
things that will be used by

289
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:01,040
billions of people, and to think
about insights, and what

290
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,100
the future will look like.

291
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,710
Get an insight into that future,
and then build for

292
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,175
that future.

293
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:08,390
And by building for it, that
will become the future.

294
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,850
So I'm very excited about the
future of technology and how

295
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,550
it's changing our world.

296
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,550
I think there are so many
opportunities for us and for

297
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,880
all of you, and I'm looking
forward to that future.

298
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,130
