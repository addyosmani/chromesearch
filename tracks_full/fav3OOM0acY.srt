1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,930

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,300
JOHANNA WRIGHT: So now
I'm so excited to

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,680
introduce Diane Greene.

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,220
Diane Greene is the
latest member of

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,930
Google's Board of Directors.

6
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,400
She's also a board member
for Intuit and MIT.

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,070
Diane is probably most well
known for founding VMware.

8
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:24,020
VMware went on to define the
visualization industry.

9
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:28,950
Diane was the CEO of VMware
from 1998 to 2008.

10
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:33,230
She took the company to $2
billion in revenue, and she

11
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,490
took the company public.

12
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,610
When I heard that I got to be
on the same panel as Diane

13
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,590
Greene, I was flabbergasted,
and so excited.

14
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,710
Despite how intimidating her
resume sounds, Diane Greene is

15
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,070
actually quite approachable.

16
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,490
I heard her speak last year at
a Google event and I went up

17
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,500
and introduced myself
afterwards, and she was very

18
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,320
friendly and nice.

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,450
So if you get the opportunity
afterwards, I would encourage

20
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,790
you to shake her hand.

21
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,450
Diane is also a national
champion sailor.

22
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,260
And with that, Diane.

23
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:10,760
[APPLAUSE]

24
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,220
DIANE GREENE: Thank you
for that introduction.

25
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,830
She went further than
I suggested she go.

26
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,940

27
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:24,390
So how did I manage to
do these things?

28
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,020
What I thought I would do is
take you on a whirlwind tour

29
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,570
of my life and try and highlight
where I thought I

30
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,750
learned valuable things.

31
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:37,860
And I grew up sailing,
racing sailboats.

32
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,760
And when you race a boat, first
you have to build a

33
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,850
team, and you have to get your
team all aligned on a single

34
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,560
goal, which is to
win the race.

35
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,270
And then you need your strategy
to win the race.

36
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,260
You have to understand what the
wind's doing, understand

37
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:58,780
what the currents are doing,
and pay attention to your

38
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,950
competitors.

39
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,840
And if your competitors surprise
you or you get a wind

40
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,850
shift, you have to immediately
react and handle that and

41
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,979
continue winning the race.

42
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:16,610
And the last thing is the
engineering around sailing.

43
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,960
You have to prepare your boat.

44
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,500
It has to be ready to go fast.

45
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,660
Then you have to tune it while
on the race course to keep

46
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,230
going fast.

47
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,990
And I think that's what
led me to train.

48
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,600
I trained as a mechanical
engineer and

49
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,040
then a naval architect.

50
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,720
I came out to the Bay Area
to San Francisco

51
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,630
for my first job.

52
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,960
And the first thing I was given
to do was analyze some

53
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,730
mooring, a mooring for an
offshore oil platform that was

54
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,560
used for firefighting.

55
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,770
And there was a big Fortran
program that looked like it

56
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,790
was the way to model this.

57
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,520
And so that's when I learned
how to program.

58
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:06,000
And it was just this incredibly

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,520
powerful tool, software.

60
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,250
You could do anything with it.

61
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,470
Got pretty excited about it.

62
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,580
Was not very excited about
sitting inside behind a desk.

63
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,780
I really came to the Bay Area
for the windsurfing.

64
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:26,470
And so I quit that job and I
moved to Hawaii where I think

65
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,340
I've had perhaps one of my
favorite periods of my life.

66
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,540
I lived sort of in a commune
where we were exploring.

67
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,110
Windsurfing was sort
of an early

68
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,910
microcosm of the tech industry.

69
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:44,420
We were just inventing
all kinds of things--

70
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,940
new sails, high aspect
sails, new shapes

71
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,740
of boards, new materials.

72
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:53,230
And all we did was build and
test this equipment every day.

73
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,290
It was really tremendous.

74
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:57,590
And from there, I went and ran
engineering for Windsurfing

75
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,190
International.

76
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,950
That was the company that had
the patent on the windsurfer,

77
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:09,700
which also taught me how abused
patents can be, because

78
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,910
they tried to control a very
rapidly expanding industry

79
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,230
with their patents.

80
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,670
I left that.

81
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,899
Well, all this time, I continued
to study software.

82
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:22,820
I went back up to the Bay Area
and enrolled in a graduate

83
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,650
program in computer science
at UC Berkeley.

84
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:31,200
Berkeley was a pretty happening
place at that point.

85
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,790
The grad students had a lab
full of brand new Sun

86
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:40,960
workstations that were based on
this Unix, a relatively new

87
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,420
open operating system.

88
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,960
Richard Stallman, who wrote
the GPL license,

89
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,770
was hanging out there.

90
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:52,240
I got to see the first graphical
user interface, and

91
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,370
it was just very exciting.

92
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,990
And I knew it's what I
wanted to keep doing.

93
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,980
I did still yearn
for adventure.

94
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,520
I've always really loved
adventure, so I took a brief

95
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,850
interlude and used my computer
skills to be the computer

96
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:14,190
expert on a marine archaeology
expedition in Sipan where we

97
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:18,460
excavated a Spanish galleon
and found gold.

98
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:24,170
And then I came back to the Bay
Area and went to work at a

99
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:27,800
succession of companies
in the tech industry.

100
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,410
The first one was Sybase, where
I really got hit over

101
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:37,550
the head with the value of
having engineers across

102
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,520
companies work together.

103
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,870
I made friends with an engineer
at Sun, it turned out

104
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,450
he was a windsurfer, and we
spend a few months windsurfing

105
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:50,050
and writing software and were
able to get sort of an order

106
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,340
of magnitude performance
increase in the Sybase system

107
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,720
running on Sun.

108
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,120
And I really used that
when I built VMware.

109
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:06,240
All three companies were quite
an education in how important

110
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,880
it is to embrace change and
always go forward, invest in

111
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,270
the future.

112
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,540
Sybase didn't want to rework
their system to support

113
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,570
symmetric multiprocessing
processing, and that's sort of

114
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,830
why Oracle eclipsed them.

115
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,930
I went to work at Tandem that
had the world's best database

116
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:30,640
management system, but it ran
on proprietary hardware and

117
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,380
proprietary operating system.

118
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:37,030
And it was too hard to see the
business model for moving to

119
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,820
commodity open systems, and
they sort of sailed into

120
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:46,000
oblivion, getting bought by
Compaq and then by HP.

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,770
And then I went to work for
SGI, which was a pretty

122
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:53,670
aggressive tech company at that
point in time and worked

123
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,750
on interactive television,
which was a

124
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,390
really exciting project.

125
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:05,580
But again, the internet
was happening and it

126
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,120
was starting at SGI.

127
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,420
But instead, the founder of
SGI, Jim Clark, left and

128
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,940
founded Netscape, and
a number of us

129
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,240
left and started companies.

130
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,400
And that's when I finally
just decided

131
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,100
to stick with startups.

132
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:24,730
And so I did two successive
smaller startups.

133
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,670
They both had great visions.

134
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,590
I would say they maybe
executed too early.

135
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,910
Nice financial outcomes.

136
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:35,340
The first one was streaming
video over the internet, low

137
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,570
bandwidth, because there
wasn't much bandwidth.

138
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:42,480
And the second was internet ad
serving, interestingly enough.

139
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:52,170
At that point I took a little
time off and decided to found

140
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:56,720
VMware, which was based on some
work my husband was doing

141
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,560
at Stanford around
virtualization.

142
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,460
And there's a few things I can
kind of relate to what we did

143
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,360
at VMware to what I had
already learned.

144
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,830
For instance, Sun Microsystems
introduced these workstations.

145
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,110
People loved these workstations,
and then brought

146
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,930
their servers into
the companies.

147
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,680
And at VMware we used
the same strategy.

148
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,510
We had a workstation software.

149
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:24,250
People loved our workstation
software, and then when we

150
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,650
came out with the server
product, were pretty

151
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,460
quick to adopt it.

152
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,760
We did amazing.

153
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,929
Our engineers worked with
the hardware vendors.

154
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,630
They worked with the
chip vendors.

155
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,870
They worked with the
storage vendors.

156
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,190
And then we worked with
all of those vendors

157
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,270
to take it to market.

158
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,669
And I'm just a huge believer in

159
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:44,510
collaboration in the industry.

160
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:48,100
And it was really effective for
VMware, but it was always

161
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,140
hard to convince other companies
to trust us and

162
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,020
partner with us.

163
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:57,110
But I think we always won,
jointly, together.

164
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:01,080
And then the last thing was just
sort of how to adapt, how

165
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,620
to embrace change.

166
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:07,430
My job changed considerably from
zero to sort of 6,000,

167
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:10,320
7,000 people the company
was when I left.

168
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,810
And it's just sort of
recognizing, OK, this isn't

169
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:19,660
working and constantly
sectioning out parts of my job

170
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:24,000
that I just didn't have time for
anymore and hiring someone

171
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,470
to do those things.

172
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:33,040
VMware was just a totally fun
adventure, building it with

173
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,450
all those people and seeing
the impact that it had.

174
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:44,450
And what I would say is, it's
not so important how.

175
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,990
There's just sort of
an infinite number

176
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,860
of ways to do things.

177
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,440
But when you see something that
you're very interested

178
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,890
in, that you think it can have
some real impact, the thing

179
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:03,030
that's important is to codify
that vision, see that vision,

180
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:06,880
enjoy the adventure of
building that vision.

181
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,230
And if you do enjoy it, it makes
it fairly easy to be

182
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,490
fearless about it.

183
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,680
