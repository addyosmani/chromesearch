1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,730
BRADY FORREST: Hi I'm
Brady Forrest,

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,900
and welcome to Ignite.

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:11,980
[APPLAUSE]

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,970
BRADY FORREST: Unfortunately, we
don't have beer this year.

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,059
You can bring that up
with the management.

7
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,180
But I'm just thrilled
to be here anyway.

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,595
And how are you all
enjoying I/O?

9
00:00:19,595 --> 00:00:23,560

10
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,680
I hope you are ready
for just kind of a

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,190
Gatling gun of ideas.

12
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,610
We have a great set of speakers
today to kind of

13
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:35,010
round out the second day of I/O.
And believe you me, these

14
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,510
people will enlighten you.

15
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,460
And what these--

16
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,250
in case you haven't been to an
Ignite before, what we have

17
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,830
here is a series of five minute
presentations, where

18
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,760
each speaker gets just five
minutes on stage.

19
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,920
They get 20 slides.

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,830
They get 15 seconds a slide.

21
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,960
And just like me, they have no
control over those slides.

22
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,530
And so it makes it for a little
bit more frenetic--

23
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,420
a little more fun if they're
drunk-- which they're not.

24
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,880
We didn't bring whiskey--

25
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,129
but it has its charms anyway.

26
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,560
And we've got a great selection
of content tonight.

27
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,650
Now Ignite, if you haven't heard
of it before, is in over

28
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,410
200 cities around the world.

29
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,630
So I encourage you to go home
and participate in your local

30
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,620
one or start one.

31
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,940
Now our 13 speakers are going to
cover topics as diverse as

32
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:26,330
the Shenzhen hardware ecosystem,
the Marvel data--

33
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:30,860
Marvel Comics, that is,
and the rise K-Pop.

34
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,080
Now, a good friend of mine who
actually spoke at the very

35
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,390
first Ignite, is here
to talk about better

36
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,950
living through Bluetooth.

37
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,200
Please welcome Dan Shapiro.

38
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,950

39
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,750
DAN SHAPIRO: Thank you Brady.

40
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,990
So I got this amazing
headband.

41
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,810
You put it on.

42
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,750
It has these little silver
eye sensors.

43
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,070
It measures the microvolt
signals coming off of your

44
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,290
brain and the twitch from your
eye muscles, sends to your

45
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,430
phone via Bluetooth, where
there's a neural network that

46
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,530
decodes them and puts
them up in a graph.

47
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,920
It's called a Zeo.

48
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,780
And it basically knows if you're
sleeping, it knows if

49
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,315
you're awake--

50
00:02:05,315 --> 00:02:07,580
It's like Santa Claus
in a box.

51
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,310
It can tell you your
sleep over the

52
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,789
course of a whole night.

53
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:12,260
I got this for my dad.

54
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,560
He wanted to learn more about
his sleep habits.

55
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,310
Unfortunately, what he learned
about his sleep is that he's

56
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,030
in the habit of grabbing the
thing off his head in the

57
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,530
middle of the night and throwing
it against the wall

58
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,800
very vigorously.

59
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,840
So he never got too
much from it.

60
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,790
But I thought it was amazing.

61
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,420
I actually have trouble falling
asleep-- always have.

62
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,800
And so I wound up getting all
this data every morning.

63
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,650
I could tell what the phases
of sleep were, if I

64
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:35,870
woke up, how long--

65
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,940
and what I learned was, I always
thought it took me an

66
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,370
hour to fall asleep.

67
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:43,440
It actually only took me half
an hour to fall asleep.

68
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,760
And this was magical.

69
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,490
Because once I knew it, I
started falling asleep in 15

70
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,560
minutes because I wasn't
stressed out anymore.

71
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,790
And once I started falling
asleep in 15 minutes I started

72
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:54,100
going to bed earlier, because
hey, I didn't, like, postpone

73
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,150
it because I thought I was going
be tossing and turning.

74
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,030
It was awesome.

75
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:03,960
So just by getting the data,
I wound up sleeping better.

76
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,960
And as the nights wore on I
wound up having more REM

77
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,760
sleep, more deep sleep, and
longer nights of sleep, even

78
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,010
though I wasn't doing any,
like, bedtime setting

79
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,100
craziness-- nothing like that.

80
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,970
I was just following the data.

81
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,480
So more data.

82
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,220
I went to my doctor and I said
I want to get a sleep study.

83
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,970
This is where they strap 20
electrodes on your skull.

84
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,600
They measure your arm motion,
your leg motion, your

85
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,600
respirometry--

86
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,480
the whole thing.

87
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,290
And it turns out I have
something called sleep apnea,

88
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,620
which basically means I
stop breathing in the

89
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,400
middle of the night.

90
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,250
So I get this sweet jet fighter
mask that I get to

91
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,400
wear every evening that prevents
the heart damage that

92
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,770
comes from sleep apnea,
and actually

93
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,170
helps me sleep better.

94
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,330
I was talking about this with my
friend Matt, who also had a

95
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,610
sleep study, and he said, you
know, my sponsor for my latest

96
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,120
video is this company up in
the corner called 23andMe.

97
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,040
You should send them
a cup of your spit.

98
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,830
Because these guys actually
measure your chromosomes, and

99
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,640
tell you all sorts of

100
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,660
interesting stuff about yourself.

101
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,620
So I drooled into a little cup,
shipped it off to them,

102
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,280
and it was amazing.

103
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,690
I learned I'm predisposed
to heroin addiction.

104
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,860
I learned I'm a descendant
from the

105
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,300
Cohen tribe of Israel.

106
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,980
I learned that I'm at seriously

107
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,560
elevated risk of dandruff--

108
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,640
3 and 1/2 times the normal
person's risk.

109
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,760
But the thing that was most
interesting was I learned I'm

110
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,625
a fast caffeine metabolizer.

111
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:25,150
Now, I've never been a
coffee drinker, which

112
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,430
is kind of a shame.

113
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,940
Because coffee is like vitamin
C. The more research that's

114
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,010
done, the longer the list of
things that coffee seems to

115
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,120
prove to prevent--

116
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,010
Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,
cavities for Pete's sake.

117
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,100
This stuff is miraculous.

118
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,510
One problem.

119
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,890
Coffee tends to lead
to heart attacks.

120
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,430
But not for fast caffeine
metabolizers.

121
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,140
Fast caffeine metabolizers who
drink coffee regularly in

122
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,360
moderation actually experience
fewer heart attacks than the

123
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,890
general population.

124
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:54,310
Sweet.

125
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,170
So now I'm drinking
coffee every day.

126
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,100
That was easy.

127
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,650
At work they offered to give
us this health workup.

128
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,790
They give you a yellow, red,
or green for all sorts of

129
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:03,980
different attributes.

130
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,440
I did it and I don't
eat particularly--

131
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,380
I eat a lot and I don't like to
exercise, so I thought it

132
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,350
was going bad.

133
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,270
They basically came back and
said, Dan, you should lose

134
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,250
some weight.

135
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,750
OK, wait.

136
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,130
This isn't like LDL
cholesterol.

137
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,400
This is physics.

138
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,560
This is mass.

139
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,900
I can measure this.

140
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,680
So I bought a Bluetooth scale.

141
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,330
Every morning I stand on
the Bluetooth scale.

142
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,820
It sends the weight
to my phone--

143
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,040
to the web--

144
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,780
and the weirdest thing
happened--

145
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,590
data.

146
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,930
Change started happening.

147
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,320
I started losing weight.

148
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,640
I didn't go on a fancy diet.

149
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,590
A friend of mine at work started
going vegan at the

150
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,020
same time, and he dropped
weight a lot

151
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,100
faster than I did.

152
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,070
But the man was miserable.

153
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:47,280
I was losing weight just by
watching what was going on.

154
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:47,490
OK.

155
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,040
Well wait.

156
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,300
Let's try exercise.

157
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,780
I've never held an exercise
regime in my life but this

158
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,545
little thing, this Bluetooth
pedometer cost $50.

159
00:05:54,545 --> 00:05:57,080
I've got one in my pocket,
gave a half dozen to my

160
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,100
friends and coworkers, and
I've gone from walking an

161
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:05,240
average of about 2,500 steps a
day to 8,500 steps a day just

162
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,580
by watching the email that
comes out every week that

163
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,680
makes fun of me for not walking
enough when my friends

164
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,360
are doing more than I am.

165
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,220
So, I'm sleeping better.

166
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,095
I'm eating better.

167
00:06:16,095 --> 00:06:18,290
I'm drinking more coffee, which
I've learned is a good

168
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:21,700
thing, and I've lost weight.

169
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,560
I am not a health guru.

170
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,990
I am no fitness expert.

171
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,890
I am not going to tell you
how to live your life.

172
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,490
But there is something I
want to suggest to you.

173
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,880
If there is some aspect of your
life that you would like

174
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,140
to change, you could do a lot
worse than finding some gadget

175
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,950
that can measure it for you.

176
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,440
Thank you very much.

177
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,320
[APPLAUSE]

178
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,300
PETER OLSON: Hi.

179
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,000
As I wait for the slides.

180
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,970
My name's Peter Olson.

181
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,480
I work for Marvel
Entertainment.

182
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,990
Some of you may have heard
of this company.

183
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,150
And I'm going to talk to you
today about the challenges of

184
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:03,000
finding structure and meaning
in very complicated data

185
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,980
sets-- say a data set that has
been put together by hundreds

186
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,840
of writers, artists, editors
over the course of 70 years.

187
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,250
Now, a lot of you probably deal
with very important real

188
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,610
world data sets, and I'm hoping
that our exploration

189
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:20,940
into fictional data sets
is of some use to you.

190
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,320
Now comic universes are
amazing places.

191
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,290
People can fly.

192
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,790
They can survive lethal
doses of radiation.

193
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,380
Southern accents sound
like that.

194
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:37,490
But they do not lend themselves
to structure.

195
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,320
But in order to represent
a universe and the

196
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,330
bibliographical things that
contain it, you need

197
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,520
structure, you need data, you
need schemas, you need

198
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,990
semantics, you need data types,
and you need a shared

199
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:55,080
understanding of how entities
behave in the universe you're

200
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,970
looking at.

201
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:59,730
And I believe personally that
data is actually part of the

202
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,360
comic's experience.

203
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,410
If you've ever been in an
argument over whether

204
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:07,150
Wolverine could beat Sabertooth,
or Batman could

205
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,320
beat Superman--

206
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,370
and I've bet a lot
of you have--

207
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,430
you've been in an argument
about data.

208
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,300
Data also gives us new
and interesting ways

209
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,900
at looking at fiction.

210
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,120
This is a graph representation
of the Marvel Universe.

211
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,170
Each point is a character.

212
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,700
Each line is an interaction
between one or more

213
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,450
characters.

214
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,690
So a first challenge--
how do you

215
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:29,450
represent a fictional entity?

216
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:32,390
Now you might think it's a
pretty simple exercise.

217
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,380
There's an entity.

218
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,100
It has attributes.

219
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,640
Those attributes are
relatively static.

220
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,679
So you think of Hawkeye.

221
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,039
He has blond hair.

222
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,299
He is an archer.

223
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:44,680
He has a purple costume.

224
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,710
He shoots arrows.

225
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:49,580
And we modeled characters like
this for a long time.

226
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,890
And then we started to look at
the stories, and we realized

227
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:56,530
that this wasn't a complete look
at how characters behave

228
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:56,890
in fiction.

229
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,590
The important thing about
fiction, and characters in

230
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,660
them, is that they change.

231
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,990
So Hawkeye has been a villain.

232
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,720
He was Goliath.

233
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,270
He was Hawkeye.

234
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,650
He was dead.

235
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,450
He was Ronin.

236
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,140
He came back.

237
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,500
And now he's Hawkeye just
in time for the movie.

238
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,960
Another challenge--

239
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:16,120
comics use bibliographical
organization to tell stories.

240
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,460
So you might think, OK
I've have seen the

241
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,960
Captain America movie.

242
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,830
I want to read the first issue
of Captain America.

243
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,600
Where should I start?

244
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Oh, Captain America,
number one.

245
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,340
Well there are six Captain
America number ones.

246
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,180
This isn't just Marvel.

247
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,910
DC just renumbered their entire
line about a year ago.

248
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,160
And renumbering is actually
a way of signaling to an

249
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,700
audience that something
important has happened in this

250
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,640
story, in this character.

251
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,770
It's actually part of the
comic's experience.

252
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,630
By the way, if you actually want
to find Captain's first

253
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:46,070
appearance, it's not in a book
called Captain America.

254
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,490
It's Captain America Comics.

255
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:52,070
Yes that is Cap punching
Hitler in the face.

256
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:56,330
The first book called Captain
America starts with issue 100.

257
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,000
This type of thing happens
all the time in comics.

258
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,870
X Men becomes New X Men becomes
X Men and then goes

259
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,680
back to X Men--

260
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,920
goes to X Men Legacy without
changing numbering.

261
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,520
The Incredible Hulk dropped its
main character but kept

262
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,630
its numbering.

263
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:15,100
The Deadpool book starts at
900 and counts backwards.

264
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,200
Oftentimes bibliographical
structures fight against story

265
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,730
experience.

266
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:22,370
If you think of stories as an
ordered sequence of events--

267
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,640
they have a beginning,
they have a middle,

268
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,950
they have an end--

269
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,810
you would expect that the books
that organize those

270
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,590
stories follow that
story in sequence.

271
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,440
So in the Spiderman books, you
would expect that a story

272
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,890
flows from friendly neighborhood
Spider Man, to

273
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:40,020
one, to two, to three,
to four, and so on.

274
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,910
But in order to read this
story-- it's call Spiderman,

275
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:45,380
The Other-- you actually have
to read across series.

276
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,670
This is very, very difficult
to represent to consumers--

277
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,630
to people who have never read
a comic book before.

278
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:57,500
So what can you do when you
have crazy data like this?

279
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,860
Well first, find atoms.

280
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,240
Find things that are
indivisible--

281
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,730
that don't change.

282
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,960
And often these atoms
are under the hood.

283
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,260
They're not in the entity you're
used to dealing with.

284
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,030
So in the example of characters,
we found the thing

285
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:14,840
that is important is not a given
set of entity attributes

286
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,750
that doesn't change.

287
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:21,510
It's that there are moments in
story time where entities have

288
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,090
specific attributes.

289
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:26,910
For comics we found that there
are indivisible units of story

290
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,410
that exist outside of the
bibliographical structures.

291
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:35,470
And those units of stories can
be organized into new and

292
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:39,270
interesting organizational
entities such as storylines,

293
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,680
such as character timelines,
and things like that.

294
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,390
So thanks.

295
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,200
If you're interested in this
type of comic arcana, we have

296
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,120
a schema.org proposal currently
under consideration.

297
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,160
And you can get me
@dethtron5000.

298
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,130
Thanks a lot.

299
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:58,490
[APPLAUSE]

300
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,980
FREDDY VEGA: My name
is Freddy Vega.

301
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,210
I came from the exotic land
of South America--

302
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,740
Colombia.

303
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:07,005
And I'm here to talk about how
we are living in the best age

304
00:12:07,005 --> 00:12:09,720
of humanity ever, and that's
thanks to education--

305
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,950
mainly online education.

306
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:12,950
There's a lot of people talking

307
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,330
about online education.

308
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,480
Coursera is incredible.

309
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,910
EdX is amazing.

310
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,160
There's something called Massive
Online Open Courses.

311
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,270
It's like a MMORPG's, but
without the multi-player part.

312
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:25,330
They are doing great things,
but online education can be

313
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,720
so, so much more.

314
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,610
This is a story that
starts in 2004.

315
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,830
I wanted to learn PHP.

316
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,770
There was such an era
when PHP was cool.

317
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:37,380
And so I went ahead and used
PHP to create Cristalab--

318
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,220
a community of web designers
and developers.

319
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,930
That community grew a lot.

320
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:43,490
We are right now at
two million unique

321
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,530
visitors per month.

322
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,100
So we decided to create
another company.

323
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,190
So with Christian Van Der Henst,
that guy over there, we

324
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,470
created Mejorando la.

325
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:52,490
Mejorando la is a company
dedicated to organize courses

326
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,510
around Spain and
Latin America--

327
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:57,900
courses about HTML5,
Node js, Python.

328
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,020
We started in 2010, and we've
already done 30 courses around

329
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,680
12 countries.

330
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,200
And we teach to 3,000 students
all of these technologies--

331
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,150
HTML5, Python, Node js.

332
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,380
We wanted to bring them the
best, not just the PHP course.

333
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,750
I'm sorry about all
the PHP lovers.

334
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,800
I'm so, so sorry.

335
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,220
These courses are great.

336
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,950
And they started to grow
incredibly, incredibly popular

337
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,980
because we were doing
something different.

338
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,250
For example I think that copying
from the projector, or

339
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,370
from a white board
is medieval.

340
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:29,840
So we have a central server
and other things to copy.

341
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,100
But traveling sucks.

342
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,480
Traveling plus 9/11
absolutely sucks.

343
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,210
And we were traveling to a
different country each week.

344
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,980
I was tired of travel, and I
wanted to fix online education

345
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,040
with a multi-player part.

346
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,230
So what's wrong with that
Massive Online Open Course

347
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,510
that we have right now?

348
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:47,480
Right now Massive Online Open
Courses are specialized CMS

349
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,680
for text and media.

350
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,150
And sadly nothing more.

351
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,940
They are doing a great job for
bringing the best content on

352
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,260
big, huge brand schools to
all people for free.

353
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,500
But they are lacking the
connection to students.

354
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,010
Coursera right now has a
retention rate of 7%.

355
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,170
EdX and Udacity have
similar numbers.

356
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,560
That means that for each 100
people that try to take a

357
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,430
course on Coursera, only
seven people finish.

358
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,780
Why is that happening?

359
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,730
So we tried to create a
different kind of system--

360
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,690
a different kind of education
system that will fix that.

361
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,780
And we were trying to gather
inspiration from where people

362
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,970
were really spending time.

363
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,890
So I tried to earn inspiration
from threaded discussions,

364
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,770
quota questions, gaming
and streaming--

365
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,940
a lot of people are spending
time over there-- and we

366
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,060
created something
called Platzi.

367
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,500
Platzi is online education
with that part.

368
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,870
We tried to bring
that community

369
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,280
part to online education.

370
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,280
We didn't have any money because
funding in Latin

371
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,760
America is almost nonexistent,
but we did

372
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,910
these on-site courses.

373
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,960
We used all the money from
the on-site courses

374
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,500
to create the platform.

375
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,240
This is the platform.

376
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,430
And it has all the things that
you would normally expect from

377
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:46,860
a platform.

378
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,350
It has guides, text,
media tutorials,

379
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,310
and blah, blah, blah.

380
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,260
But interesting things are
on the right side.

381
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,630
That's our question
and answer system.

382
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:58,030
A question in our system is
only as big as a tweet.

383
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,140
People have to be specific
to ask questions.

384
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,420
You have nested comments,
very similar to a

385
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,250
mobile version of Reddit.

386
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,720
You have upboats, downboats.

387
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,990
We also have a system where
people can write answers with

388
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,330
Read Text and code without
needing to

389
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,550
run Markdown or BBCode.

390
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,510
Just [INAUDIBLE], as far as
I know, is the only one.

391
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,740
Our first course generated
40,000 questions.

392
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,190
And 99.1% were rightfully
answered, mostly by the

393
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:24,750
students, because we were
making the best

394
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,850
students answer it.

395
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,170
And the slow or normal students
are being leveled out

396
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,450
by those best students.

397
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,950
We also have live streaming
classes.

398
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:34,070
We are using a technology that
enables us to do online

399
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,580
streaming in PCs, desktops,
mobiles, et cetera.

400
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,250
When a teacher wants to share
a file, he just right-hand

401
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,560
drops, and the students
see it on the corner.

402
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,110
And if it can be selectable,
its colored, et cetera--

403
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,770
also for any kind of file.

404
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,360
Chats are normally useless.

405
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,980
But in our system, the students
use the chat as an

406
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,580
annotation system and it has
the stars, an about.

407
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,660
So the system outergenerates
a summary of each class

408
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,110
automatically, after one
of each classes.

409
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:06,030
In three courses, 97% of the
students finish everything.

410
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,090
We've done three
courses so far.

411
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:08,960
So it works.

412
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,840
Our system works.

413
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,360
How much have we done this?

414
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,430
How many students
have we reached?

415
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,890
We've done three courses
this year.

416
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:21,410
We had 3,400 students, charging
$95 to each of them.

417
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,460
And right now we have only
done this in Spanish.

418
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,932
We are really wondering what
happens if we do this in the

419
00:16:27,932 --> 00:16:30,110
English world.

420
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,075
What I want to say is that
online education is not about

421
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:32,600
technology.

422
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,220
It's not even around who's
teaching or who's certifying.

423
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,370
It's about finding a way to
connect the students to our

424
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:41,300
students, to create the
workshops, the study groups,

425
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,260
and the things that
the students

426
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,230
normally do in colleges.

427
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,690
And if you want to learn more,
if you want to know more about

428
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,240
the platform, or you want to
say, hey you are wrong,

429
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,290
education is like this and like
that, please contact me

430
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,215
over there on Twitter.

431
00:16:52,215 --> 00:16:52,390
Thank you

432
00:16:52,390 --> 00:17:00,070
very, very much [APPLAUSE]

433
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,870
NATHAN FREITAS: So I was
encouraged yesterday at the

434
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,910
keynote, hearing about Android
and the reach of Google

435
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,200
wanting to expand to the rest
of the world that we haven't

436
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,180
gotten to yet with
this technology.

437
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,380
Unfortunately, the rest of the
world doesn't always work the

438
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,260
way we think it should, and
doesn't treat users with the

439
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,170
same respect that we
think they should.

440
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,670
The great firewall might be a
familiar term to a lot of you

441
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,195
but the problem today is more
one of a panopticon--

442
00:17:22,195 --> 00:17:25,940
an all-seeing eye at the end of
a gun, where every action a

443
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,819
user is doing is being
surveilled.

444
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:29,550
We're not talking about
blocking a site.

445
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,470
We're talking about all the
activities of a user in their

446
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,380
mobile device and their
digital life.

447
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,320
And the surveillance
is crowdsourced.

448
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,700
It's not just one firewall.

449
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,550
It's every person around you.

450
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,210
The onus is on the company,
the service provider, the

451
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,910
software creator to observe
and watch and report and

452
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,260
filter to create a harmonious
society.

453
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,100
It's not about websites
anymore.

454
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,970
It's about ebooks and apps--
filtering them, blocking them,

455
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,550
reporting their authors.

456
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,170
It's about blocking artists
and cultural figures from

457
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:59,690
communicating such as Ai
Weiwei's Gangnam Style video,

458
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:02,030
which never reached a mass
audience in China.

459
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,090
So into this comes an
app like WeChat.

460
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:08,000
WeChat is yet another of these
all-messaging, all-phone, take

461
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,150
all your communications and
put it through our app--

462
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,480
all with stickers and emoji,
and colorful icons, and a

463
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,260
whole lot of fun and
great marketing.

464
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,900
So WeChat is a Chinese
company.

465
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,120
This is what's interesting.

466
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,580
It's been growing like
crazy since 2012.

467
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,570
It's got numbers, WhatsApp
numbers, Facebook numbers,

468
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,150
Twitter numbers-- it has HangOut
numbers in and it

469
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,600
didn't even auto-install
the app.

470
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,330
So it's really crazy.

471
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,840
So you take this issue that it's
a Chinese company working

472
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,050
within a Chinese society, and
of course you have baggage

473
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,966
like restricted keywords
happening, right?

474
00:18:36,966 --> 00:18:38,660
So keywords being filtered--

475
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,530
Tibet, Taiwan, Tiananmen
obviously, but much more.

476
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,240
Eviction, environment,
everything--

477
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,860
and now that's exported
to the world.

478
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,870
So what we've seen is that
Hu Jia, a famous Chinese

479
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,300
activist, decided, well maybe
I can use this WeChat to

480
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,810
organize and communicate.

481
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,200
And what he found was
the opposite.

482
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,030
It had made the surveillance
state that much more

483
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:00,070
efficient, within an hour, able
to report and communicate

484
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,370
and interrogate.

485
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,460
Expand this to others
in China--

486
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,720
Tibetans who have been fighting
a battle to have

487
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,940
their country back for
over 50 years.

488
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,880
They gravitate towards
smartphones because it helps

489
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,440
them communicate to
their exile and

490
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,350
diaspora family members.

491
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:17,470
At the same time as the rise of
WeChat, we've seen a rise

492
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,650
in the self-immolation protest,
where Tibetans are

493
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,070
setting themselves on fire
in order to have

494
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,320
their voices heard.

495
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,380
So of course this is a topic
of discussion for Tibetans

496
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,130
around the world.

497
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,000
They're using WeChat.

498
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,840
Of course they are.

499
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,500
It's the best way to
get information

500
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,720
when it's not filtered.

501
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,490
And so inevitably we see Tibetan
monks being arrested

502
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:37,690
for using WeChat to talk about
things that are happening

503
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,670
right around them
with each other.

504
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:43,390
Instead of texting or calling,
they're using this friendly

505
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,950
auto-surveillance state app.

506
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,160
Now there is a light at the
end of this tunnel.

507
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,370
There's something that Tibetans
are doing themselves.

508
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,320
A project called the YakChat,
based on code by

509
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,750
[? Marley Moxenspike, ?]

510
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:59,750
that uses secure messaging along
with delightful icons to

511
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,820
create a humorous response to
such a bad, onerous problem.

512
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,670
So YakChat is an app that is
available for Android.

513
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:06,610
It's open source.

514
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:10,150
But it's not really about WeChat
or China or Tibetans.

515
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:10,860
This is really about you.

516
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,330
Because the problems in China
are quickly becoming problems

517
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,160
everywhere.

518
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,380
The tools are being
commoditized.

519
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,760
The software is easy.

520
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,480
Everyone knows how to do
surveillance state stuff.

521
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,160
So you really need to encrypt
all the things, right?

522
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,330
Because you don't know who might
be doing something that

523
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,140
someone doesn't like.

524
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,970
You could be gay in Uganda, you
could be a woman in Saudi

525
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,260
Arabia, you could be a
journalist just about

526
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,990
anywhere, these days.

527
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:39,250
You can't expect the network
to behave properly.

528
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,000
Man in the middle attacks
are normal.

529
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,430
CA cert route, pwnage, and
exploits are normal.

530
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,780
You need to use things like Tor,
and build proxying into

531
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,830
your applications.

532
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,120
Twitter added proxy support
into Twitter.

533
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,910
Why does your app not
have proxy support?

534
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,940
You need to expect the internet
may not exist.

535
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,010
And if you've been at this
conference, you can sympathize

536
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:02,320
with that because every single
app just falls over and stops

537
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,270
working as soon as there's
no internet, right?

538
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:07,510
So you need to build in
peer-to-peer, mesh.

539
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,690
And finally--

540
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:09,670
well not finally, there's
a few more slides--

541
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:10,790
free beer is good.

542
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,870
Free stuff is great, especially
for activists and

543
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,050
people around the world.

544
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:16,310
But you need to consider the
impact on speech, and the

545
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,780
ability for them to express
themselves and to build on

546
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,990
your code, and to build
on what you've done.

547
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:23,230
So YakChat came out of
TextSecure which is an open

548
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:26,740
source project from Moxie.

549
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,760
To stop being serious for a
moment, emoji are awesome.

550
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,460
Emoticons, stickers, emoji--

551
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,450
I love these things.

552
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,640
People that work in movements
that work for change are often

553
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,580
very creative and expressive.

554
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,080
So you can't make an
app that's boring.

555
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,500
Ultimately, China is an amazing
culture and it's an

556
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,190
amazing place.

557
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,340
And I want them to take their
place in this world.

558
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,850
And I love cultures
within China.

559
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,430
There's so much-- the
Tibetan culture--

560
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,190
you can learn more
about China.

561
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,545
The reason WeChat is taking off
is they know more about us

562
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:54,220
than we know about them.

563
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,010
So you need to take
responsibility and make your

564
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,030
apps great.

565
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:59,470
And use some of this code
we have at Guardian

566
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,550
Project to do that.

567
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,925
Thank you very much.

568
00:22:01,925 --> 00:22:09,350
[APPLAUSE]

569
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,120
KIM TECK CHUA: Hello everyone.

570
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,140
I'm Kim from Singapore.

571
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:18,180
So as you can see from the slide
show, this is the Helix

572
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,330
Bridge we have in Singapore.

573
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,720
And the reason why it's being
named Helix Bridge is because

574
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,410
it's part of the
DNA structure.

575
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,410
And it also represents life.

576
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:29,600
So the topic I'm talking about
today is digital afterlife.

577
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,790
So, in the 18th and 19th
century, when a user actually

578
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:37,010
passes away, how do they
actually announce it to the

579
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,620
family members and the
rest of the people?

580
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,220
They do it through
word of mouth.

581
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,500
So what they would do
is that, you tell--

582
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:42,730
OK.

583
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,810
You get how many of the
gold, how many of the

584
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:45,990
house, and so on.

585
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:49,630
And fast moving forward into
the 1960's and through the

586
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,660
1990's, people actually
started using a will.

587
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:56,655
And they would write down in a
will how much of this that you

588
00:22:56,655 --> 00:22:57,580
will actually get.

589
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:04,830
And moving forward to 2000, we
are still living in a written

590
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:08,160
will concept, where we
don't have a concept

591
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,530
of the digital world.

592
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:14,840
So when a user has passed on,
let's say in social media and

593
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:19,130
stuff, the account is actually
left vacant.

594
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:23,240
So we can see that in social
network, we have more than one

595
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,030
billion mildly active users.

596
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:29,650
And this is has actually created
a very huge potential.

597
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:34,100
And you can also see that, as
more and more users get

598
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,440
online, we actually have
more online friends

599
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,530
than offline friends.

600
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,920
So this a page of Larry Page.

601
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,220
And I got it from my Google+.

602
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,880

603
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,640
We have a lot of information
overload where information

604
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,660
comes from all around the
world, all around the

605
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:52,710
different content, like multiple
devices, like, in the

606
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:56,230
day we use the iPhone or we
use the Google Android.

607
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,000
And at night, we
use the tablet.

608
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,300
So we also face, more and more,
older generations coming

609
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,530
into the online world.

610
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:07,990
So we have seen the younger
generation has actually

611
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:12,060
populated the social
media online.

612
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,800
And from this graph you can
actually see that the fastest

613
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,080
growth now is actually coming
from the older generation.

614
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,010
So the question lies within
what happens if the user

615
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:27,490
actually passes on to the world,
and who will actually

616
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:29,610
take care of all that
digital excess, like

617
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:30,930
on the social network.

618
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:34,340
Or if suddenly you find one
day, this person no longer

619
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,840
updates the posts on Facebook
or Google+.

620
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:43,450
As far as the email, we have
seen more and more of us are

621
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:46,760
storing a lot of valuable
information in emails.

622
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,960
What happens to the email
accounts if no one is

623
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,270
accessing it?

624
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:54,570
And we can really see from
financial accounts, like the

625
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:58,740
stock market, 4x, and the rest
where we put in a lot of

626
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,910
investment in it--

627
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:02,560
a lot of finance and wealth.

628
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:07,570
And what happens if one fine
day, we do not have--

629
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:11,220
nobody is aware of what the user
has actually put in into

630
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,460
the online accounts.

631
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,430
And also digital access like
Google drive, Cloud,

632
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,620
Dropbox, and so on.

633
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:20,680
So we create a lot of content
every day, and this is

634
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,440
constantly uploaded to
the online storage.

635
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,690
And also the online
subscriptions, like movies,

636
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,350
gaming accounts, and so on.

637
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,210
So more and more information
is being uploaded and

638
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:35,460
subsequently, everyone is
concerned about creating more

639
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,350
information.

640
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:42,060
But this also creates a term
called the digital black hole,

641
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:45,550
where data is being left
vacant on the server.

642
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:50,040
So for all the developers out
there, you can see that

643
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,160
digital actually grows.

644
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,630
And all you need is more storage
on the internet.

645
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:58,460
But there will be a problem
where you will see, what

646
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:02,410
happens to the inactive data
storage out there.

647
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:05,090
It will increase on its own.

648
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,560
And nobody is aware of why it's
happening over there.

649
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:11,280
So this is a pretty
big problem--

650
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:16,940
And of course, missing person
in action, where we have our

651
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,600
friends, and our online friends,
where you won't be

652
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,630
actually aware of what happens
to each of them until we

653
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:28,390
actually find out from the
physical connections.

654
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:32,280
So recently Google actually
launched the Google inactive

655
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:38,620
account manager, where it allows
the user to set a time

656
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:44,010
time-out period where you will
ping the user, after the user

657
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,660
doesn't log in after
a certain time.

658
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:50,620
So this is wise as the first
step in making the data

659
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,370
management more efficient.

660
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:58,350
And of course we will
subsequently see more and more

661
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,210
relevant services coming
out in the market.

662
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,070
And the last slide
which I want to

663
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:04,100
share is unspoken words.

664
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:08,860
So I'm sure that many of us have
many words which we may

665
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:14,073
not say to each and every
one of them at certain

666
00:27:14,073 --> 00:27:17,070
times of your life.

667
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:20,810
So this is one [INAUDIBLE]
of vSwitch I

668
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:21,750
would like to highlight.

669
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,410
So thank you.

670
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:27,120
[APPLAUSE]

671
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:27,640
JOYCE KIM: Hi everybody.

672
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,040
I'm Joyce Kim and I'm here to
talk to you about Korean pop.

673
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,230
So quick quiz-- how many of
these guys do you recognize?

674
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:35,700
On one side we have Kim Jung
Un, the Supreme leader of

675
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,180
North Korea.

676
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,150
In the middle we have Psy,
the Korean pop sensation.

677
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,310
And the last guy?

678
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,150
That's just my baby brother.

679
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,820
I threw him in there because he
looks like the other guys.

680
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,700
So Korea is awesome.

681
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,550
Korea has actually been
impacting pop culture on the

682
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,290
web for quite some time now.

683
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,600
And I'm here to give you a crash
course on the industry

684
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,820
that brought you
Gangnam Style.

685
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:55,435
So Korean pop got its start in
1992, when a band call Seo

686
00:27:55,435 --> 00:27:57,670
Taiji Boys debuted on the Korean
equivalent to American

687
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,360
Idol on TV.

688
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,170
They were unlike anything
Korea had ever seen.

689
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:03,890
They had electronic music
mixed with hip hop.

690
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,440
They had these choreographed
b-boy moves, and the judges

691
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,470
absolutely hated them.

692
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,130
They came in dead last.

693
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:11,050
But the very next day, their
sales started to go through

694
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:13,260
the roof, and they quickly
became the longest running

695
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,900
number one hit in
Korean history.

696
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,730
After that we had a flurry
of girl bands and

697
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,470
boy bands come up.

698
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,750
They look kind of silly to
us right now, right?

699
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,020
We're not used to seeing
groups like this.

700
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,310
Really?

701
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:26,370
If we look at the '90s here in
the US, it actually wasn't

702
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:26,960
that different.

703
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,090
We had the Spice Girls.

704
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,480
We had New Kids on the Block.

705
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,720
We had the Backstreet Boys.

706
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,590
So the reality is that pop
music is really about

707
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,840
manufactured groups.

708
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,840
And if we go back a little bit
further in history we can end

709
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,040
up in the Motown era.

710
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:43,180
So Motown came about at a time
when TV distribution was new.

711
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,880
And for the first time, people
really start to care about

712
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,320
what the singers looked like.

713
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,980
So I want you start thinking
about Korean pop as the next

714
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:54,220
iteration of the Motown model,
only for the internet era.

715
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,870
So let's talk about
the people.

716
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,960
Korean pop stars, like their
Motown predecessors, tend to

717
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,420
be ridiculously good looking.

718
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,380
And it's not like they went to a
school of really hot people,

719
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,040
and then decided to make
music together.

720
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,180
They are assembled this way.

721
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,060
They are brought together
through a series of intensive

722
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:10,620
auditions and scouting that
happens all across the world.

723
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,920
And because Korean pop always
had its eye on international

724
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,220
growth, they really recruit
talent that

725
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,600
speaks foreign languages.

726
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,880
So these two singers, who are
really popular in Korea, are

727
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,030
not even Korean.

728
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:23,180
He's Thai-American and she's a
Chinese-American rapper from

729
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,780
L.A. But both of them speak
Korean fluently.

730
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,100
So the reason they speak Korean
fluently is because

731
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,620
most Korean pop stars are put
through a very intensive,

732
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,420
full-time, two to seven year
training program, from

733
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,780
audition to debut, where they're
trained in everything,

734
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,110
from singing and dancing,
and of course,

735
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,890
more foreign languages.

736
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,750
So you're probably asking, why
they always so focused in

737
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,620
foreign languages.

738
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:46,080
Well it's because the fact that
people outside of Korea

739
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,070
don't speak Korean.

740
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:51,670
So how do they deal with
this challenge?

741
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:54,390
Anybody that's worked with
content on the web knows that

742
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,480
internationalization is a really
hard nut to crack.

743
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,300
So how did Korea take
this issue on?

744
00:29:59,300 --> 00:29:59,920
It comes down to one fact.

745
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,750
Korea is really wired.

746
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,820
We have fastest internet
in the world.

747
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,300
People are always connected.

748
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,070
And what this culture of
connectedness has created is a

749
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:12,110
nation full of online marketing
experts, from

750
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,580
StarCraft to Psy.

751
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,210
Koreans just really know
how to use the web.

752
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:19,490
So Korean music executives--

753
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:20,760
they kind of looked
at the situation.

754
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,450
They said, you know what, we
think we can use the internet

755
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:24,660
to get more fans.

756
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,060
But how do you really start to
communicate with fans that

757
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,640
don't speak the same
language as you?

758
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,250
One option is photos.

759
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:33,140
And Twitter became a great way
of posting photos online to

760
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,390
talk to fans that didn't speak
the same language as you.

761
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:36,956
Do guys know who this cat is?

762
00:30:36,956 --> 00:30:39,010
This cat is more famous
than all of us in

763
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:40,440
this room put together.

764
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,010
He's owned by a Korean pop
star named Hee Chul.

765
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:47,260
And this cat spent most of his
2011 hanging out on the global

766
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:50,180
Twitter trending list alongside
Justin Bieber.

767
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,870
And the reason that is, is that
Hee Chul would tweet a

768
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:54,340
photo of his cat, and then the
internet would just explode,

769
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,970
because we know that the
internet is powered by cats,

770
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:58,950
so it had that impact.

771
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,420
So from here they
went to YouTube.

772
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,800
YouTube was used really
differently.

773
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,870
Because they wanted
international sales, they

774
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:06,150
started to change the songs
and add really catchy

775
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:09,090
repetitive English lyrics,
for better or for worse.

776
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,810
And the subtitled versions
would end up on YouTube.

777
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:13,140
And this allowed non-Korean
fans to sing along to the

778
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,250
songs that they loved.

779
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,380
The other thing they did is they
invested really heavily

780
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,540
in the music videos.

781
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,100
Korean music videos are epic.

782
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,630
They're insane.

783
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:23,550
They are designed to tell a
story to somebody who doesn't

784
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,880
speak the language.

785
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,430
You can see that Gangnam
Style is kind of the

786
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,650
epitome of that trend.

787
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:30,630
So where does Psy fit
into all of this?

788
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,410
It's kind of interesting to
note, in Korea, Psy is

789
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:35,500
represented by an agency called
YG Entertainment, one

790
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,920
of the top three record
labels in Korea.

791
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,850
YG was founded by the same
singer whose own debut was

792
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:43,150
ridiculed by the
judges in 1992.

793
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:45,970
So Psy is repped by the
godfather of Korean pop.

794
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,970
Now this guy pretty much hacked
television distribution

795
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:50,500
in Korea in 1992 by becoming
a breakout success.

796
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,670
In the past few years, he's
been focused on internet

797
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,480
distribution and figuring
out how to make

798
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,750
that work for K-Pop.

799
00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:00,220
So it's no accident that Gangnam
Style became a success

800
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,430
on YouTube, because this man
had spent years focused on

801
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,590
internet distribution.

802
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,770
So what did you guys
know about Korea

803
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:05,310
before you came in?

804
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,900
You knew that we make
great phones that

805
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,760
most of you guys have.

806
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,060
You know that we kick ass in
StarCraft But now you know

807
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,230
that we can dance, and that
it's a nation full of user

808
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,550
acquisition experts.

809
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,720
So hopefully in the past few
minutes,I've piqued your

810
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,550
curiosity a little bit
about Korean pop.

811
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,720
If you want to learn more, I
made a playlist on YouTube.

812
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,560
So you can go to that bit.ly
link, slash kpop101 to see

813
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,370
some of my favorites and some
historic K-Pop videos.

814
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:26,329
Thanks.

815
00:32:26,329 --> 00:32:31,600
[APPLAUSE]

816
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,070
JOYCE KIM: So they're going to
be switching the slide deck.

817
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,150
And they wanted to
take a picture of

818
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:34,950
everybody in the meantime.

819
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:37,050
So everybody get up and do
your best horsey dance.

820
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:39,610
Or at least put your hands up
in the air and smile so this

821
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,490
gentleman can take a
photo of everybody.

822
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:44,195
Hi everyone!

823
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:45,884
All right great.

824
00:32:45,884 --> 00:32:47,315
Oh, one more for him.

825
00:32:47,315 --> 00:32:50,660

826
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,910
Thanks, everyone.

827
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:59,110

828
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,150
PANOS PAPADOPOULOS: Thank
you very much.

829
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,890
Unfortunately, my presentation
has no beautiful girls.

830
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:05,420
It's mostly about crisis
and money lost.

831
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,570
So, you know, I'm from Greece,
so I'm the right person to

832
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:11,130
talk about the StartApps and
how to save Greece-- not.

833
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:13,550
So I'm Panos Papadopoulos.

834
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,630
I'm the founder of Bugsense.

835
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,630
It's one of the most used
Android SDKs in the world,

836
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,770
actually after Google
and [INAUDIBLE].

837
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,880
And we started during
a time of crisis.

838
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,710
And a crisis is not something
that you're going to react.

839
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,000
It's something you
have to plan.

840
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,380
Because there is this function,

841
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,850
The Kondratieff Wave.

842
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:29,310
And he was an economist in the
Soviet Union, and he found out

843
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,850
that capitalists have
these cycles, so it

844
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:33,390
distracts and recreates.

845
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:36,390
And then he found out that the
capitalism is more stable, so

846
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,730
they sent him to Siberia.

847
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:40,380
So I was in Greece, when I was
a student, and there was the

848
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,110
Olympic Games.

849
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:41,975
We were in the Euro.

850
00:33:41,975 --> 00:33:43,270
Everything was great.

851
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:46,560
And everybody wanted to be
working in the public sector,

852
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,320
and be a teacher
for 400 years--

853
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,670
for 2000.

854
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,340
But then they said I have
to invest in knowledge.

855
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,220
And you know, here
we're close.

856
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,830
And we're in the news every day,
which is awesome, because

857
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:58,730
we have all the TV studios in
the world in Syntagma Square--

858
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:00,590
the Doctor Who-- we
have everyone.

859
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,610
If you want to be famous,
come to Greece.

860
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:04,830
So then there was-- every day
you listen to the news.

861
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:05,950
On Monday, the banks
are closed.

862
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,530
So I was betting here.

863
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:10,210
I was staying in a motel in
Mountain View, dirty.

864
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:12,810
And then I was listening to the
mandate there would be no

865
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:13,929
ATM to get money.

866
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:16,230
So you can imagine that's a
great time to have a StartApp

867
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,190
and you have great psychology.

868
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,600
Of course it's not.

869
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,219
But what can you do?

870
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:21,300
This is life.

871
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,699
Bad things happen, and the only
thing we can do is burn

872
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:25,500
the ships and go forward.

873
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,850
That's what the Athenians
did when they were

874
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:29,219
attacked by the Persians.

875
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,190
So what we do?

876
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,290
You know, we're developers.

877
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:32,429
You can find a job everywhere.

878
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:35,210
But we wanted to have
our own business.

879
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:38,900
And so this advertisement in
the airport, for HSBC.

880
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,520
Every company is going
to be multinational.

881
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,639
So you can be [INAUDIBLE]

882
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,690
at selling souvenirs to
tourists, but you have to

883
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,020
speak, like, ten languages.

884
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,040
You can even make shoes.

885
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,620
You can sell them online.

886
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,710
And of course there's
this StartApp

887
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,100
movement, which is global.

888
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,730
And you can make a business--
a thriving

889
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:52,500
business in a weekend--

890
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,469
of course not.

891
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:55,909
But everybody in the world can
create something online and

892
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:56,659
put it and make money.

893
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:58,680
Of course you knew
that already.

894
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,630
So it's very easy to
do that these days.

895
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,910
Everything is flat.

896
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,550
You have great services, like
Google App Engine, and

897
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,070
Twitter, Reddits to promote.

898
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:07,620
We started with Agility Group
to find the first market.

899
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,420
We hosted the Google App
Engine to be scalable.

900
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:13,250
We built an Android with the
fastest growing platform.

901
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,080
And of course we found
code to keep up the

902
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,360
with the first iteration.

903
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,850
We're didn't start
from the scratch.

904
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:19,080
Challenge accepted, yes.

905
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:19,750
Now we're a StartApp.

906
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,280
We're famous.

907
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,150
We're going to be
at Tech Runs.

908
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,650
We'll be there at [INAUDIBLE].

909
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,900
And this is how you're going to
make money after we raise

910
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,580
like a few million funds.

911
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,070
Of course this is not the
way it is when you're in

912
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,740
a country in crisis.

913
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,670
So you go back to the basics.

914
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,950
What I'm going to do here--

915
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,180
actually it's about jobs.

916
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,740
I want a job for me,
first of all.

917
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:39,110
But a StartApp is not
freelancing, so you have to

918
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,110
find other people.

919
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,570
And you have to respect the
fact that, in crisis, they

920
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:43,490
feel insecure.

921
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:44,500
So they need a job.

922
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,010
They need a job that
they can relate to.

923
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,120
It can be interesting.

924
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,810
You don't want them to go to
another country, because it's

925
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,600
technology, and it's
very challenging.

926
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,820
So you have to have a mission.

927
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,670
And the mission is
self-improvement--

928
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:57,460
self-improvement, personal
growth, and of course, have a

929
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,130
nice payday at the
end of the month.

930
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:00,610
And this is what keeps
you going.

931
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:03,273
Because you don't make money all
the time, but you have to

932
00:36:03,273 --> 00:36:05,180
have a mission when you're
in a crisis.

933
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,970
So you're in a crisis.

934
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:08,330
You are the center
of the world.

935
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:09,930
But basically you're
not in the network.

936
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:11,832
You're not in the network that
matters, which is the Silicon

937
00:36:11,832 --> 00:36:14,510
Valley, or whatever you do
according to your business.

938
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,490
So if you're a great developer,
you have money.

939
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:17,500
But if you're not
a center in the

940
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,950
network, this is a problem.

941
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,260
And of course revenue matters.

942
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,390
Cash flow is king.

943
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,520
Your competitors have
a lot of money.

944
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,420
But you're in crisis.

945
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,820
So the only thing you can
do is look at this--

946
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,540
your cash flow.

947
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,720
So yes it's ten Euro cents,
or ten drachmas.

948
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,190
The next day it's twenty
drachmas-- it's double--

949
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,340
still drachma though.

950
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,170
So you are the whole StartApp.

951
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:36,120
And this is the good thing.

952
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,280
Journalists, they
like the story.

953
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,730
You have two guys from Greece.

954
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:39,890
They have to battle
with this crisis.

955
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:41,690
So go on, and tell the story.

956
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:42,960
So people love the stories.

957
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,710
And you are on the news.

958
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,560
And because you're on the news,
you can attract talent.

959
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,240
You can attract talent
through stories.

960
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,590
And of course you have
to be a Spartan.

961
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,940
Actually, I am.

962
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,350
You have to battle, not only
because you have to prove

963
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:55,180
yourself to us, because you
are from nowhere, but also

964
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,270
because of your competitors--

965
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,900
you have the perception about
yourself that you are a

966
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,170
lesser, because you don't have
the basic capital, or you're

967
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:01,820
on no Tech Runs.

968
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,970
And you have to fight.

969
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,710
And then, you know, everything
is systemic.

970
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,590
You cannot be on your own
and make something.

971
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,590
You have also to create
the ecosystem in your

972
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,360
city or your country.

973
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,530
We do it in Greece, people do it
in Barcelona with Barcelona

974
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,720
I/O. So it's not
about yourself.

975
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,820
It's about the ecosystem
of where you are.

976
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,830
And then after you have the
velocity speed, think big.

977
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,430
No, you're not allowed, because
there's more StartApp

978
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,360
in the crisis.

979
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,550
You can do things better.

980
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,870
So your competitors
are big in the US.

981
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:25,250
So what?

982
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:25,400
Go away.

983
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:25,660
Go to Japan.

984
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,300
Go to Korea.

985
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:27,795
You go to China.

986
00:37:27,795 --> 00:37:29,340
There are opportunities
everywhere.

987
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,360
It's just about the
perception.

988
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,400
Don't think you are miserable
because you're in a country

989
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,450
hit by crisis.

990
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:35,830
And of course there is slack.

991
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:39,310
If you are a villager back in
15th-century Europe, you will

992
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,020
be a villager for the
rest of your life.

993
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,240
There's no way to be
a cleric or a king.

994
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,730
So the US revolution told us,
you can't be everywhere.

995
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,640
You can try, but there
is only lack.

996
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,360
So don't blame yourself
all the time.

997
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,230
It's also a matter of flack
if you don't make it.

998
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:51,740
Crisis.

999
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:54,560
That's a varied stereotype, but
crisis is an opportunity.

1000
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,466
So plan for the next crisis and
said opportunity is there.

1001
00:37:57,466 --> 00:38:06,040
[APPLAUSE]

1002
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:06,800
MARCO COCHRANE: Hello.

1003
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,450
So I did "Bliss Dance" for
Burning Man in 2010.

1004
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:15,390
At the time I had never done
anything that big or built

1005
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,590
anything in that way.

1006
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:24,170
And the way I did it was to
follow my bliss, and let doors

1007
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,590
open where I didn't know
doors existed.

1008
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:30,090

1009
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:32,020
I'm really interested
in patterns and

1010
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,480
structure in the universe.

1011
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,310
And I used to dream
this every night--

1012
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:41,450
triangles and triangles and
triangles and triangles.

1013
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:43,990
I got into patterns that exist
in the universe that are

1014
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:45,600
repetitive.

1015
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:50,060
And one of them is an attractor
that's surrounded by

1016
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,690
material and energy.

1017
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:55,340
If you use that as a model, it's
a little scary because

1018
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,800
there are no straight lines.

1019
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,050
It's all spirals.

1020
00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:00,180

1021
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:04,200
So you have to trust that what
you need is going to come when

1022
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,450
you need it.

1023
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:07,920

1024
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:14,312
So in the center of this project
was a sculpture that I

1025
00:39:14,312 --> 00:39:18,700
did in 2006.

1026
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,280
OK.

1027
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,810
And I did it with Deja
Solis, the model.

1028
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:26,470
And there's something--

1029
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,120
one of my favorite pieces.

1030
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:33,430
So what I needed to do was
enlarge it to 15 feet.

1031
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:36,200
And I had never done anything
that big before, so I used a

1032
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,320
panograph, which is in the
background there--

1033
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,030
a tool from 1602--

1034
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,580
very low tech.

1035
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,910
That's the armature
for the clay.

1036
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:48,230
And I put clay all over it.

1037
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:50,740
And it ended up pretty good.

1038
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,710
There it is.

1039
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:54,940
That was the biggest sculpture I
had ever done at that point.

1040
00:39:54,940 --> 00:40:00,660
So the next thing was to draw a
pattern on that clay piece.

1041
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:05,040
And that was actually a lot of
work to figure out how to make

1042
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,980
all the lines flow together,
and build a mold.

1043
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,100
So that's-- you can see
the lines drawn

1044
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,520
on it and the mold.

1045
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,780
So I needed the mold so I could
make a hard copy, so I

1046
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:21,500
could use the panograph again
to build basically a giant

1047
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,220
point cloud, that could hold
itself up, and deal with high

1048
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:27,000
winds and reality.

1049
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,330
So one of the problems with that
is how do I hang these

1050
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:32,490
balls in three dimensional
space, that I would then

1051
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:35,510
connect to.

1052
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:38,260
So I had to invent this little
tool here that's made out of

1053
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:43,570
goose necks and magnets to hold
the balls in 3D reality

1054
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:45,760
and weld to them.

1055
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,640
There's 55,000 connections
and I couldn't

1056
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,920
possibly do that myself.

1057
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,370
So one of the flow things that
happened is people came into

1058
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:57,100
my life that I didn't even know,
who spent six months at

1059
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:01,070
a time for free to help
me build this thing.

1060
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:04,560
And many other people
helped too.

1061
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,870
One of the other aspects that
was really important to me was

1062
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:08,860
the beauty of the
piece itself.

1063
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:12,290
And the structure was much more
beautiful than I thought

1064
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:13,560
it would be in my mind.

1065
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,920
And that was really fun--

1066
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,530
fun to play in and
fun to climb on.

1067
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:20,990
One of the things that
I hadn't even

1068
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,640
thought of was the color--

1069
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,760
the lighting system.

1070
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,050
I hadn't dealt with
RGB LEDs before.

1071
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:30,720
And somebody put one inside of
that structure and it just

1072
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,740
made it come to life.

1073
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:37,240
And it became a big aspect
of the sculpture itself.

1074
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,100
Risk-taking--

1075
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,820
the face on something--

1076
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,650
on a sculpture is really
important.

1077
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:46,440
In doing this wire
frame, I had to--

1078
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,700
I just hoped that when I put
mesh on it, it would actually

1079
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,910
work and be a beautiful face.

1080
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:52,460
And it did.

1081
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,450
I was really happy with it.

1082
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:57,580
So that year was total success
and wonderful.

1083
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,140
And the flow happened.

1084
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:04,650
So in 2011, I brought the next
piece, which is "Truth is

1085
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:07,900
Beauty." This is the
torso of it.

1086
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,790
And I wanted people to be able
to climb in it and hang out in

1087
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:13,870
this, structure like we had
done when we built it.

1088
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:16,740

1089
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:20,880
So this year we're bringing the
finished product, which

1090
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,350
will be 55 feet tall.

1091
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:27,155
That's the clay version of it
to Burning Man this year, so

1092
00:42:27,155 --> 00:42:29,740
if any of you are going,
it will be there.

1093
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:33,660
I always like to think big
to keep myself motivated.

1094
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:38,570
So before I die, I hope
that this happens--

1095
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:42,740
200 foot "Bliss Dance"
on Alcatraz.

1096
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:47,770
That's the Statue of Freedom
on a prison.

1097
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:49,080
You've got to go for that.

1098
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,770
So truth is beauty.

1099
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:54,940
Your truth is your bliss.

1100
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:57,880
And if you find that within
yourself, and follow it, doors

1101
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,530
will open where you didn't
know they existed.

1102
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:01,510
Thank you.

1103
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:08,210
[APPLAUSE]

1104
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,600
CHARLIE DECK: OK I'm going to
shift into a different kind of

1105
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:15,560
beauty here because I'm about to
share something spectacular

1106
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,470
and surprising about numbers.

1107
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:23,050
And it all starts with a doodle
in 1964, at UC San

1108
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:27,270
Diego where this man, Stanislaw
Ulam, the legendary

1109
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:29,390
mathematician who helped
invent the computer and

1110
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:33,370
discover nuclear fission, is
stuck in a department meeting.

1111
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:35,440
And he's bored.

1112
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,580
But he's a mathematician,
so when he's

1113
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:40,750
bored he doodles numbers.

1114
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:45,690
One, two, three-- the numbers
are marching out in a spiral.

1115
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:49,260
And in his boredom he decides
to see what happens when he

1116
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,840
circles the prime numbers.

1117
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,490
And when he does something very

1118
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:56,500
special does indeed happen.

1119
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,670
The prime numbers tend to line
up along these diagonals.

1120
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:02,860
And that defies our intuition
that prime numbers are hard to

1121
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:05,770
calculate or are distributed in
a randomish way along the

1122
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:07,900
number line.

1123
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,220
And it turns out that there is
something to these spirals

1124
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,230
with respect to primes.

1125
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:14,290
And they're called Ulam Spirals
after this man.

1126
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:16,440
When I found out about them
I couldn't wait to

1127
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,750
start making my own.

1128
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:20,520
So I started my own doodle,
but this time in code.

1129
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,620
And I'm going to share some
of my explorations.

1130
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,990
I started simply though, just
with the number line--

1131
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:28,120
One, two, three, four,
in order left to

1132
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,290
right, top to bottom.

1133
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:33,050
The bright squares are primes
and the dark squares are

1134
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:35,450
everything else.

1135
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:39,270
Now I taught my doodle how to
go into the Ulam Spiral.

1136
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:41,670
And as you can see, we are way
more zoomed out than we were a

1137
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:43,030
second ago.

1138
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:45,160
But you can see just how
consistent the pattern of

1139
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,030
primes is along those diagonals,
but also how

1140
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:49,840
inconsistent it is.

1141
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,210
Is this just a coincidence
in the noise?

1142
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:54,570
Well let's compare it to a
grid where I've lit up

1143
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:56,000
completely random numbers.

1144
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,690
And I think that will convince
you that there really is

1145
00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:59,840
something special
going on here.

1146
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,560
But what's really exciting is
it's not just this square

1147
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,140
spiral I constructed triangular
spirals, hexagonal

1148
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:11,050
spirals, circular spirals, and
in each one we see some kind

1149
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:14,610
of recognizable, and conspicuous
order going on

1150
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:15,820
with respect to the
primes-- they're

1151
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:17,580
these little diagonals.

1152
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:18,740
So what's going on?

1153
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:21,390
We're curling numbers in a
spiral, and for some reason

1154
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:23,030
the prime numbers seem
to be lining

1155
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:25,650
up along these diagonals.

1156
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:28,900
Well I went online, I found
some code that fits three

1157
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:31,670
points to a quadratic equation,
plugged that into

1158
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:35,370
the doodle, and I went and
saw what would happen.

1159
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:36,520
And it was incredible.

1160
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:39,190
It turns out that these
diagonals line up perfectly

1161
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:41,370
along just that kind
of equation.

1162
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:45,560
I could select a given arm in
the prime-- in the number

1163
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,330
spiral, I mean.

1164
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:49,630
And that meant I could address
the question of whether we're

1165
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:52,710
seeing the same order across
these different spirals.

1166
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:56,230
Is the prime-rich vein in one
spiral the same as the

1167
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:58,320
prime-rich vein in another?

1168
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,620
Well in my doodle, I had all the
features already there, so

1169
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:03,370
I could see for myself.

1170
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:05,080
This is just a tiny selection
of all the different

1171
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:08,300
possibilities I could have shown
you, but I think you can

1172
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,590
see that there is a relationship
there.

1173
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:11,660
But it's complex.

1174
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,250
And it's varied.

1175
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:16,490
And this-- you know, from here
I could construct more

1176
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:18,186
complicated arrangements of
numbers, or maybe we could

1177
00:46:18,186 --> 00:46:20,950
look at semi-primes or
perfect numbers.

1178
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:23,770
But there's even more beauty
if we go simpler.

1179
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:25,350
And what's simpler than
prime numbers

1180
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:26,930
is just simple multiples.

1181
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:29,150
And these are the same number
spirals, but I'm just

1182
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:31,970
highlighting 22, 44, 66, 88--

1183
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:34,760
multiples along those spirals.

1184
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,650
And if I animate the multiple
that I'm highlighting, you get

1185
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:40,570
a whole secondary
pattern that--

1186
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:43,250
like a perceptual phenomenon
that emerges from the

1187
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:45,640
underlying patterns.

1188
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:49,600
And again, I mean I cut this
talk in half, and half again.

1189
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,120
There's so much more I could
share with you, but I want to

1190
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,230
leave you with two big
picture points.

1191
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:57,210
And one is about the process,
that my doodle was just as

1192
00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:00,210
casual as the original doodle
in that department meeting.

1193
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:03,270
It's just the product of some
procrastination, a little bit

1194
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:06,180
of creative coding, and I got
to experience the thrill of

1195
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:09,000
exploring some of these
ideas for myself.

1196
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,360
That can and that should be one
of the joys of having some

1197
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,790
coding skills.

1198
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:15,630
Our skills are like a prosthesis
or an amplifier for

1199
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:16,760
imagination.

1200
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,970
And that's not just an
empty platitude.

1201
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:23,400
The second point is about why
it's important to look at

1202
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,710
something so abstract
this way.

1203
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:28,000
In the platonic sense,
these patterns

1204
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,100
have always been here.

1205
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,360
They always will be here.

1206
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:34,110
It's like the sound of a tree
falling in the woods, but it's

1207
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:37,220
always there whenever we
bother to tune into it.

1208
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,620
Perceiving and appreciating
this kind of abstract

1209
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:42,730
phenomenon is one of the joys
of being a thinking human

1210
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:45,770
being in this day and age.

1211
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:48,750
And algebra and taxes
and spreadsheets--

1212
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:51,690
they might have turned us off
from numbers, but never forget

1213
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:54,640
that just below the surface,
there's a startling and

1214
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:55,670
magical beauty.

1215
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:58,280
It's just a simple
one, two, three.

1216
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,720
You can play with the tool that
I used-- or that I made--

1217
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:01,450
the doodle.

1218
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:02,720
It's at primes.io.

1219
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,150
My name's Charlie Deck.

1220
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:05,410
My ID is Bigblueboo.

1221
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:06,580
Thanks a lot.

1222
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:14,360
[APPLAUSE]

1223
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,520
LIRON SHER: Good afternoon,
everyone.

1224
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,100
My name is Liron Sher.

1225
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,460
I'm an Israeli entrepreneur.

1226
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:23,140
I'm here to speak about the
Israeli StartApp ecosystem,

1227
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:27,230
and how it is to be
an entrepreneur.

1228
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:31,270
So I just started my journey
about one year ago.

1229
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:32,940
Of course, I'm from Tel Aviv.

1230
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:36,940
And basically, Tel Aviv is the
capital of StartApp in Israel.

1231
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:44,020
We have some StartApp in Be'er
Sheva and Haifa, but the most

1232
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:45,940
StartApp ecosystem
is in Tel Aviv.

1233
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:49,140
You can see that if you throw a
dime in Tel Aviv, you going

1234
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:50,620
to hit a StartApp.

1235
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:55,190
It may be a StartApp, it
may be an accelerator--

1236
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:58,460
everything you need in order
to be a StartApp,

1237
00:48:58,460 --> 00:48:59,710
you have in Tel Aviv.

1238
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:00,930
So come to Tel Aviv.

1239
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:03,130
It's very good for to
make a StartApp.

1240
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:04,540
But in order to make a
StartApp, you have

1241
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:05,960
to get a cool idea.

1242
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,330
Everybody in Israel thinks you
have an idea, because we've

1243
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:09,230
been through the army.

1244
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:10,550
We can do everything.

1245
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:12,010
So we think we can
do a StartApp.

1246
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:14,450
But not all the StartApp in
Israel are successful.

1247
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:16,600
Some of them-- most
of them, less.

1248
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,610
But you have to have a big
idea in order to get a

1249
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:20,020
StartApp in Israel.

1250
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:23,870
So my first tip for you,
get a good idea.

1251
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:26,960
Do a good idea, so
it can last--

1252
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,790
in order to get your StartApp.

1253
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:32,480
And then, before you can go to
the StartApp journey, to be an

1254
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,080
entrepreneur, think
about yourself.

1255
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,400
Are you up to it?

1256
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,150
Can you be an entrepreneur?

1257
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:39,080
Can you do a StartApp?

1258
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,470
Can you be a CEO?

1259
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:42,480
Because if you're not
up to it, give up.

1260
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,090
Go be a salary man.

1261
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:45,840
But if you can do
it, just do it.

1262
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,640
And then, build your A-Team.

1263
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:50,400
Build the one that will
help you to go this

1264
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,980
long journey of StartApp.

1265
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:53,050
They have to be a good guy.

1266
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:54,770
They have to be the best guys.

1267
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:56,080
They have to be a tech guy.

1268
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:59,730
Get the guy that will complete
you as you can.

1269
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:02,690
But then, are your partners
up to it?

1270
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:05,020
Find out first that if you have
the tech guy that's very

1271
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:08,290
good in tech, will he help
you do it your way?

1272
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:08,940
Will he be there?

1273
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:11,460
Will his family support
your friend there?

1274
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:13,800
Think about it before you choose
your colleagues through

1275
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,140
this long journey.

1276
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:17,520
This is what I can
share with you.

1277
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,730
Now find the business model.

1278
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:21,350
You have to find the business
model for your StartApp.

1279
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:23,215
I found four business models
for my StartApp, so I

1280
00:50:23,215 --> 00:50:25,370
recommend you to find at
least two business

1281
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:26,710
models for your StartApp.

1282
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:29,220
Otherwise, don't think about
starting developing.

1283
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:31,570
Don't do anything before you
find a business model.

1284
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:32,990
And think about the user.

1285
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:34,670
Will you use your StartApp?

1286
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:36,410
Will you use your application?

1287
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:38,150
Are you going to be the user?

1288
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:39,980
Because if not, give up.

1289
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,900
You have to think about the user
and what they're going

1290
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:45,740
earn from using your
application.

1291
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:48,100
Then you look for money.

1292
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:51,210
Every angel can say, hey, you
have a good idea, but show me

1293
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:53,960
some traction, and I will
give you some money.

1294
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,580
But then, if I have traction,
why do I need money?

1295
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:58,610
If I have traction, I would
have already the egg.

1296
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:00,150
It's like the chicken
and the egg.

1297
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:02,330
So then you find yourself
bootstrapping.

1298
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:04,570
You leave your company-- you
leave your day to day job and

1299
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:06,890
start bootstrapping
your company.

1300
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:07,370
OK.

1301
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:08,680
What next?

1302
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:11,140
Every day you have to
build something.

1303
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:14,030
And then what do
you want to do?

1304
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:16,450
Then you think about
what is the MVP--

1305
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:18,340
minimum viable product?

1306
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:20,260
Because you cannot build
everything while you are

1307
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:20,950
bootstrapping.

1308
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:24,800
So from one end you have to
be as minimal as you can.

1309
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,550
From the end, you have
to get more users in

1310
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:28,390
order to get the money.

1311
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:32,060
So think about what is your MVP
before you go into market.

1312
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:34,550
And then we are doing mobile
application, so we have to

1313
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:38,100
choose what you're going to
do, Android or iPhone.

1314
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:40,750
People are still using iPhone
these days, so you cannot

1315
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:44,180
neglect them, especially
in Israel.

1316
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:46,780
And then you find out that
you want to use HTML5.

1317
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:50,560
One year ago, HTML5 was
very hard to debug.

1318
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:54,530
Also it doesn't work the same
on every iPhone and Android.

1319
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:59,310
You find yourself working
differently

1320
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:00,740
on two Android devices.

1321
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:01,520
So what should you do?

1322
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,380
But my app is viral.

1323
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:07,400
So if I develop only for
Android, I will miss half of

1324
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,910
the market.

1325
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:11,290
So we decide to develop natively
iPhone and Android at

1326
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:11,870
the same time.

1327
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:15,450
I find myself writing Java code
and x code, and I said

1328
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:17,270
otherwise reversal.

1329
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:19,220
And then we try to
find out backend.

1330
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,160
What is the best backend
for you?

1331
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:26,560
I recommend going Google App
Engine, but if you're not a

1332
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,640
Python developer or Java
developer, how can you use the

1333
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,180
Google App?

1334
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:32,440
That's how it was back then.

1335
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,450
So we decided to go to
Amazon Web Services.

1336
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:37,280
So Amazon Web Services
is a great tool.

1337
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,640
They have great tools to scale
up, but you have to be an IT

1338
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:44,450
guy in order to work
with Amazon.

1339
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:47,140
So my recommendation for you,
if you're going for Amazon,

1340
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:48,970
just to be an IT guy.

1341
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:50,590
And now we released our MVP.

1342
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:51,080
Our MVP is ready.

1343
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,350
We're sending it to
all our customers.

1344
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:55,390
And everybody is saying,
where is this feature,

1345
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:56,760
where is that feature?

1346
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,490
And you have to tell your
friends what is MVP, because

1347
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:02,810
nobody except everyone
knows what is MVP.

1348
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:03,840
My name is Liron Sher.

1349
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,520
And I hope I've enlightened you
to something about Israel

1350
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:07,310
and StartApps.

1351
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:08,750
And thank you very much.

1352
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:14,912
[APPLAUSE]

1353
00:53:14,912 --> 00:53:16,790
BUNNIE: Hi everybody.

1354
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:17,500
I'm Bunnie.

1355
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,780
I'm also hailing
from Singapore.

1356
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:24,200
And I'm here to talk to you
today about an ecosystem that

1357
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:27,110
I've been exploring in China
called the gongkai ecosystem.

1358
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:30,690
It's kind of about how ideas
get shared in China,

1359
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:32,370
China-style.

1360
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:35,500
A hobby of mine is I like to go
to Shenzhen, every now and

1361
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,750
then and look for wacky
pieces of hardware.

1362
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:41,340
This one here is it looks like
a mouse, except for the

1363
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:43,110
screwed up logo.

1364
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:46,580
But when you go ahead and you
turn it over, you find that on

1365
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:47,810
the inside--

1366
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:51,160
advance slide, advance slide--
there is in fact a full GSM

1367
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:54,250
phone on the inside complete
with a camera.

1368
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:56,510
It makes calls and so forth--

1369
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:57,620
rather funny.

1370
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:00,820
A more serious kind of
application you can find out

1371
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:04,470
there, sort of unique, is
they have this phone

1372
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:05,540
which is for children.

1373
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:06,980
It's a child's safety phone.

1374
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:09,100
It only allows you to dial five
numbers, so your kids

1375
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:11,240
can't text message other
kids in class, and

1376
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,300
so on and so forth.

1377
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:15,270
It's an interesting sort
of application of the

1378
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:17,290
technology out there.

1379
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:19,770
Other devices that I have also
found out there that I found

1380
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:22,740
very interesting is this
one, which is a phone.

1381
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:24,150
It looks kind of plain.

1382
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:26,470
But the interesting thing about
it is that it's $12.

1383
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:28,340
And it was kind of
the retail price.

1384
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:29,460
It wasn't with a contract.

1385
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:32,480
Which means that the actual cost
of manufacturing was less

1386
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,790
than $12, probably
around $8 or $10.

1387
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:37,070
So of course, I buy it and I
take it apart to see how the

1388
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:37,870
heck they do this.

1389
00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:40,790
I find on the inside they've got
a multi 100 megahertz arm

1390
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:42,370
CPU, with 8 megabytes
of memory, a

1391
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:44,150
Bluetooth, quad-band GSM--

1392
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:45,250
all this kind of cool stuff.

1393
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:47,280
And I go, geez, I really want
to build one these.

1394
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,470
How do they do this?

1395
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:50,630
So I go on the net and I
start looking around.

1396
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:54,360
And I find I can actually
download the PCB files.

1397
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,510
I can download the schematics.

1398
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:58,120
I can go ahead and actually
source the chips in the

1399
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,850
markets, and they're only,
like, two bucks.

1400
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:02,910
Why haven't I seen more StartApp
doing this kind of

1401
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:04,510
stuff, is what I wonder.

1402
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:08,970
And when you take a look at the
StartApps that they do in

1403
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:11,390
China, a lot of them are around
phones, whereas in the

1404
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:13,825
US, a lot of the StartApps are
around "app-cessories." They

1405
00:55:13,825 --> 00:55:15,520
don't actually build
phones themselves.

1406
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,030
They build stuff that
work with phones.

1407
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:20,750
And I wonder is it because
maybe there's no economic

1408
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,990
incentive to actually
build phones.

1409
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:24,690
And that's not the case.

1410
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:26,770
There's a company in China
called Xiaomi that was founded

1411
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:29,700
in 2010, and two years later it
was valued at $4 billion,

1412
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,420
half that of Nokia.

1413
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:33,890
So clearly there's an economic
incentive to go ahead and

1414
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:35,860
build these kinds of phones.

1415
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:39,190
In fact, the thing is that if
you look at the documentation

1416
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:40,820
you get, they've got
confidential

1417
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:42,140
written all over it.

1418
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:45,470
They have dubious copyright
terms, and so on and so forth.

1419
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:49,640
So in fact, there's an IP
barrier that is presented for

1420
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:52,890
people who are trying to build
these things from the West.

1421
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:55,890
Now this set of terms here,
which we are all very familiar

1422
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:59,270
with, means about as much to the
people in Chinese as if we

1423
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:01,070
were to fill this with Chinese
characters to you.

1424
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:03,800
They don't know, you know,
confidential, DMCA, patents--

1425
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,610
all these sorts of things.

1426
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:05,980
They kind of just--

1427
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:07,720
they're in an ecosystem
that is free of

1428
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,070
these kinds of things.

1429
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:11,270
So it's interesting
that in China I

1430
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:13,770
can access the designs.

1431
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:16,340
And so the kind of open, and
sort of the end result--

1432
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:19,570
well it's not really open with
the big "O." It's not open in

1433
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:22,690
terms of GPL, or Creative
Commons, or

1434
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:23,770
these kinds of things.

1435
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:27,080
Fortunately in Chinese, they
actually have different words

1436
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:30,890
for big O Open, like Foss, which
is kaifung, and open

1437
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:32,770
with a little "O" which means
you can just sort of share it,

1438
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:33,320
and it's out there.

1439
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,760
It's called gongkai.

1440
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,650
And in order to sort of
differentiate and sort of-- if

1441
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:40,040
I told people, oh I'm looking
at the open harder ecosystem

1442
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,270
in China, people would be
like, you're crazy.

1443
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:41,970
It's not actually open.

1444
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:44,885
So I just call it the gong kai,
harder ecosystem, to sort

1445
00:56:44,885 --> 00:56:49,970
of differentiate between what
would be the open ecosystem

1446
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:53,320
versus just a simple open
access ecosystem.

1447
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,920
It's interesting to look at
sort of now the kind of

1448
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,320
mainstream platforms
per ecosystem.

1449
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,840
So in the Western open style,
we have the Ardweno.

1450
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,810
It's probably the most
popular one.

1451
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:06,760
It's 15 megahertz CPU you can
buy it for $29 in SparkFun.

1452
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,130
And then you go ahead and you
look at the gongkai ecosystem.

1453
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:11,400
And if you remember we have
these devices that are like

1454
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:15,270
200 megahertz and quad-band GSM,
and they cost about $12.

1455
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:18,340
And of course they're not
legally licenses open, but

1456
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:20,907
these schematics, the sharings
of all the blueprints and the

1457
00:57:20,907 --> 00:57:23,370
plans through the different
people out there enable them

1458
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:26,060
to go ahead and slot these into
other products, which

1459
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:28,410
enable them to do things, wacky
things, like put a phone

1460
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:31,410
inside of a mouse, or make a
phone with only five buttons

1461
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:33,900
so your kids can use
it, or just sell

1462
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:36,460
outright phones for $12.

1463
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:38,520
So people then ask me-- or
like, kind of the next

1464
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:41,200
question is, how does the system
work in the face of

1465
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,020
such theft.

1466
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:44,720
Is it the case that the
consumers are just paying the

1467
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:45,750
entrepreneurs--

1468
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:47,000
thieves, if you will--

1469
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,560
and they're taking all the
value, which would be the case

1470
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,810
if they were just, like,
stealing software music.

1471
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:57,630
In fact the entrepreneurs have
to rely on the entire value

1472
00:57:57,630 --> 00:57:59,030
ecosystem behind them.

1473
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:01,610
They have to rely on contract
manufacturers and brands,

1474
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:05,250
channels, supply chains-- they
have to buy the chips from the

1475
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:07,610
people who they're stealing
the documentation from.

1476
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:11,000
And people have to get
SIM cards with the

1477
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,240
carriers and so forth.

1478
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,850
So in fact all the players still
make money, it's just

1479
00:58:14,850 --> 00:58:15,800
distributed a little
bit differently.

1480
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,880
There's a little more money for
the people at the bottom,

1481
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:20,190
and the carriers and the chip
manufacturers don't have quite

1482
00:58:20,190 --> 00:58:21,240
as much control.

1483
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:24,050
So that is about the quickest
introduction I can give you to

1484
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:25,120
the gongkai ecosystem.

1485
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,860
There's a lot more
stories to tell.

1486
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:27,600
Thanks very much.

1487
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:36,120
[APPLAUSE]

1488
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,540
JAISEN MATHAI: Hello
my name is Jaisen.

1489
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:40,690
So let's talk about the
preservation of human history.

1490
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:42,810
And there's something that all
of us in this room have in

1491
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:45,180
common, and it's that
we all have a story.

1492
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:47,800
And as humans, we're actually
natural storytellers.

1493
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,330
So I'm going to go into my story
a little bit, and it

1494
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:53,400
starts back with my mother,
back in 1955.

1495
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,990
This is a picture of her
family-- her brothers,

1496
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:58,080
sisters, parents, and
grandparents.

1497
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:01,030
Some of these people aren't
even living anymore.

1498
00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:02,230
These are not miserable
people.

1499
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:05,380
Indians don't smile in
any photographs.

1500
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:07,460
But this is where
my story starts.

1501
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:10,400
If you fast forward a little bit
to 1981, this is what my

1502
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,070
parents would send me out of the
house looking like on the

1503
00:59:13,070 --> 00:59:14,920
day that they take
pictures of kids.

1504
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:17,960
You can see the disgust
on my face.

1505
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:22,070
But this is evidence that
I'll show you in a

1506
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:23,700
little bit of something.

1507
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:27,080
This is actually one of my
favorite pictures that I have.

1508
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,530
I despise fishing.

1509
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:29,660
I'm not patient enough for it.

1510
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:33,290
But this is a photo of my
father and myself--

1511
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:36,010
apparently I caught something
and it was a picture worthy.

1512
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:38,210
So, fast forward a
little bit more.

1513
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:41,280
This is a photo of me
and my grandfather.

1514
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,910
He's passed away, and
he lived in India.

1515
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:43,950
I grew up in the US.

1516
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:46,170
So the time that I did
get to spend with him

1517
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:48,160
was very, very valuable.

1518
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,740
And so this is part
of my story.

1519
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:52,000
And I've told it to
a lot of people.

1520
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,700
But the interesting thing is,
in 2010, I wasn't just a

1521
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:56,810
storyteller anymore.

1522
00:59:56,810 --> 01:00:00,240
I became a story preserver
when I had my son.

1523
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,780
And so it really started
changing how I looked at all

1524
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:05,370
this content that I'm taking.

1525
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:07,940
I have a bunch of pictures
of my kids.

1526
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:08,910
But it doesn't start there.

1527
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:11,330
We have to go back, like, 5,000
years, when the ancient

1528
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:14,510
Egyptians were writing
hieroglyphics on the walls of

1529
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:18,010
caves so that future generations
could see them,

1530
01:00:18,010 --> 01:00:20,390
little knowing that people would
be devoting their entire

1531
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:23,780
lives 5,000 years later
studying that content.

1532
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:26,720
And it's very sad for me to
stand up here and say that

1533
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,610
technology has really failed
us in this aspect.

1534
01:00:29,610 --> 01:00:32,180
It's much more easier for us to
capture moments like photos

1535
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:34,960
and videos, but it's more
increasingly easy for us to

1536
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,920
lose all of that content
as well.

1537
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,910
And so this happens
by-- is users--

1538
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:43,350
what people do is upload all
their content to any number of

1539
01:00:43,350 --> 01:00:44,650
service providers.

1540
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:47,720
And in doing so, we then entrust
the service provider

1541
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:51,610
to not only maintain our data,
but to preserve our data.

1542
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:54,305
And the internet, if it's proven
one thing, it's that

1543
01:00:54,305 --> 01:00:55,260
that doesn't work.

1544
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:59,530
It's like handing our car keys
to these guys and hoping that

1545
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,300
when they're done parking and
bringing it back, that

1546
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:03,450
everything is still in the
glove compartment.

1547
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:07,390
But what if we could actually
write applications in a way

1548
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:10,330
that's different from how we had
done in the past, giving

1549
01:01:10,330 --> 01:01:12,880
us something similar to what
car manufacturers do

1550
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:13,940
with a valet key.

1551
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:16,770
And if you're thinking, oh well,
that doesn't actually

1552
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:18,980
solve the problem that
I'm talking about.

1553
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:22,150
And so Albert Einstein
once had a quote.

1554
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:26,250
He said that you cannot change
the problems by using the same

1555
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:28,610
thinking that you did when
you created them.

1556
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:33,360
And so what I'd like to do is
ask all of us to stop thinking

1557
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,980
about the way that we've always
developed applications

1558
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:37,910
since the start of
the internet.

1559
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:38,700
This is a photo.

1560
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:40,110
This is really important
stuff.

1561
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:44,090
This is a photo that was found
in the notebook of a soldier

1562
01:01:44,090 --> 01:01:45,180
during the Holocaust.

1563
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:47,080
And on the back of it,
it was written,

1564
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,050
The Last Jew of Vinnitsa.

1565
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:50,700
This has become one of
the most valuable

1566
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:53,540
artifacts of the Holocaust.

1567
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:54,530
And so--

1568
01:01:54,530 --> 01:01:54,990
I lied.

1569
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:57,910
Technology hasn't actually
failed us yet.

1570
01:01:57,910 --> 01:02:00,580
But this is where we have to
actually think about writing

1571
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:05,250
applications and services
for users that put data

1572
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:08,560
portability and data ownership
as first class citizens.

1573
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:12,800
And for me I'm most passionate
about the decoupling of data

1574
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:17,360
storage and application logic,
and how that can apply to

1575
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:20,250
software that users
and companies use.

1576
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:24,980
And as a result I started to
open source project called the

1577
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:27,700
Open Photo Project, which
is now called Trovebox.

1578
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:29,310
It's 100% open source.

1579
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:32,590
And the purpose of this is
to provide a service for

1580
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:34,890
individual users and
organizations to allow them to

1581
01:02:34,890 --> 01:02:38,540
have 100% data portability
and ownership of

1582
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:39,830
all of their content.

1583
01:02:39,830 --> 01:02:42,270
And so we have Android
applications.

1584
01:02:42,270 --> 01:02:43,870
We have iPhone applications.

1585
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:45,870
We have a web application.

1586
01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:48,320
And an entire API stack and
language findings in every

1587
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:49,210
popular language.

1588
01:02:49,210 --> 01:02:53,340
And all of this is available
on GitHub.

1589
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:56,810
And so what we've done is we
started this initially on

1590
01:02:56,810 --> 01:02:57,350
Kickstarter.

1591
01:02:57,350 --> 01:02:59,660
We went and partnered with
Mozilla as part of the WebFWD

1592
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:02,260
program, and we received funding
from the Shuttleworth

1593
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:04,680
Foundation, which was started
by Mark Shuttleworth.

1594
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,270
And we're off to really
great start.

1595
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:09,770
But what I'm here today is to
try to get as many people to

1596
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:12,960
help us, either by participating
in the project

1597
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,990
that we've done, or start
thinking about this in the

1598
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:18,080
applications that you build.

1599
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:20,880
How can you decouple data
storage from application

1600
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,860
logic, so that when a service
ends up shutting down, all of

1601
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:27,120
your user data doesn't
go along with it.

1602
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,890
This is all the information if
you want to chat with me

1603
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:30,050
afterwards, or catch
me on Twitter.

1604
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:30,973
Thank you.

1605
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:33,290
[APPLAUSE]

1606
01:03:33,290 --> 01:03:36,290
BRADY FORREST: Thank
you very much.

1607
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:39,280
So we've got just one
more speaker.

1608
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:40,100
He's a good friend of mine.

1609
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:41,900
We worked together at Microsoft,
and been to Burning

1610
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:42,920
Man a couple of times.

1611
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,950
And this year he's got
two books out.

1612
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:48,160
And so he's here to talk about
your brain on Google.

1613
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,660
Please welcome Ramez Naam.

1614
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:51,420
RAMEZ NAAM: Awesome.

1615
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:52,660
Thank you Brady.

1616
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:53,695
My name is Ramez Naam.

1617
01:03:53,695 --> 01:03:55,190
I write science fiction.

1618
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:58,260
And I have a novel out that's
about the ultimate Google I/O

1619
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:02,760
The I/O of electronics and data
directly into your brain.

1620
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:05,550
Now you already know about this
topic in your familiarity

1621
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:09,330
with great American
philosophers, like this man--

1622
01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:13,550
Keanu Reeves, who said I know
Kung Fu What I'm here to tell

1623
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:16,950
you about is that this is no
longer just science fiction.

1624
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:19,720
It's actually becoming
science fact.

1625
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:23,240
And the motivator is not
Hollywood, it's medicine.

1626
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:26,160
We already have cyborgs
among us.

1627
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:29,250
In particular, a number of
people around the world carry

1628
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:31,180
the cochlear implant.

1629
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:34,670
The cochlear implant looks
like it's a hearing aid.

1630
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:36,590
You'll see a photo of
it in a moment.

1631
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:38,440
But it's not actually
a hearing aid.

1632
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:41,650
It's a device that picks up
sound from the environment

1633
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:46,200
around you, and then bypasses
the ear entirely and beams it

1634
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:49,100
into Keanu over and over and
over and over again.

1635
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:53,650
No, it picks up sound, and
bypasses the ear, actually

1636
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:58,260
transforms sound into nerve
impulses in the auditory nerve

1637
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:02,060
that go straight into the human
brain, unlike a normal

1638
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:04,940
hearing aid that just cleans up
sound and plays backsound.

1639
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:07,740
So it's actually interfacing one
type of data to the brain.

1640
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:11,610
And as a result about 200,000
people around the world, like

1641
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:14,580
this four-year-old girl who is
hearing for the first time,

1642
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:17,030
are now cyborgs who can
hear because we've

1643
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:18,180
learned to do that.

1644
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:21,140
We've also taken data from
inside the brain and sent it

1645
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:22,880
out into digital systems.

1646
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:25,500
This man, Johnny Ray,
was paralyzed by a

1647
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:26,910
stroke, that him--

1648
01:05:26,910 --> 01:05:30,810
left him unable to move from the
neck down, unable even to

1649
01:05:30,810 --> 01:05:32,590
speak, only able to blink.

1650
01:05:32,590 --> 01:05:36,120
But his doctors implanted the
first ever human brain implant

1651
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:39,020
in the motor cortex that allows
him to, by thinking

1652
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:42,300
about it, move a cursor on
an on board screen--

1653
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:44,770
online keyboard--

1654
01:05:44,770 --> 01:05:47,170
and type out messages to
his friends and family.

1655
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:50,450
Which is a big quantum leap up
from blinking once for yes and

1656
01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:51,630
twice for no.

1657
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:55,560
And now this tech is moving
towards actual approval as a

1658
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,900
medical technology.

1659
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:59,710
This woman last year was
implanted with the top of its

1660
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:01,850
line system that allows
her to control a

1661
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:03,820
multi-access robot arm.

1662
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:06,390
And what you see is that she's
feeding herself coffee for the

1663
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:07,560
first time.

1664
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:11,040
We've also sent vision
into the brain.

1665
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:14,680
This man, Jens, was rendered
blind age 19.

1666
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:18,550
At age 40, this cyborg
eye was implanted.

1667
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:22,890
It captures images and then it
sends them into a jack in the

1668
01:06:22,890 --> 01:06:26,790
back of his skull, straight
into his visual cortex.

1669
01:06:26,790 --> 01:06:29,140
And it restores vision, of
a crappy kind, but a

1670
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:30,480
quantum leap up.

1671
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:33,610
Now humans have more than just
sensory data and motor data.

1672
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:35,580
We also have these
higher functions.

1673
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:38,390
Who here has seen the
film "Memento"?

1674
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:39,270
Some of you.

1675
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:42,700
Well this character Lenny can't
form long term memories

1676
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,570
because of damage to part
of his brain called the

1677
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:45,760
hippocampus.

1678
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,580
So seeking to fix that, doctors
and scientists have

1679
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:51,040
built a hippocampo
prosthesis--

1680
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,840
a chip that simulates that
part of the brain.

1681
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:56,800
And in erratic experiments,
it's able to restore the

1682
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:59,630
memory of rats with brain
damage, and actually go beyond

1683
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:01,430
that and give them
super memory.

1684
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:05,260
These rats learn better than
normal healthy rats.

1685
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:07,450
Now we've gone better to that
and we've gotten into

1686
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:09,000
decision-making and IQ.

1687
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,150
These monkeys have had their
performance on a monkey IQ

1688
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:13,810
test-- a pick and match test--

1689
01:07:13,810 --> 01:07:16,720
degraded by repeated
doses of cocaine.

1690
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:20,760
They think they've got better,
but they didn't.

1691
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:24,020
But a chip implanted in their
frontal cortex can actually

1692
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:27,100
restore them back to
normal and beyond.

1693
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:30,300
They got about 10 points better
scores on these tests

1694
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:33,320
than normal, healthy monkeys
with this frontal cortex chip,

1695
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:36,170
which of course leads to the
cyborg Planet of the Apes.

1696
01:07:36,170 --> 01:07:38,350
Now we don't just use computers
for thinking or

1697
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:39,260
calculating anymore.

1698
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:41,350
We use them as communication
devices.

1699
01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:43,850
And that's where this will
become transformative.

1700
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:46,630
Because if we can send data in
and out of one brain, we can

1701
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:48,620
transfer it between
multiple brains.

1702
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:50,870
Now Dartmouth is very
interested in this.

1703
01:07:50,870 --> 01:07:54,870
Their Enhanced Battlefield
Communications program has

1704
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:58,140
funded this study, which takes
two monkeys in separate rooms,

1705
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:01,380
sound proof, with electrodes
in their auditory cortices.

1706
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:04,130
And they play a sound for one
monkey, and monkey two can

1707
01:08:04,130 --> 01:08:07,530
hear that sound and can
identify what it is.

1708
01:08:07,530 --> 01:08:10,880
In humans, we've even put
people in FMRI machines.

1709
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:13,270
We've shown them images like the
one on the left, and the

1710
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:16,569
image on the right is
reconstructed by an algorithm

1711
01:08:16,569 --> 01:08:18,899
looking at the brain scan,
and nothing else.

1712
01:08:18,899 --> 01:08:21,109
It's not very good yet, but you
can kind of see that it

1713
01:08:21,109 --> 01:08:22,810
can tell what's going on.

1714
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:26,000
And the folks who brought you
enhanced rat memory are

1715
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,479
working on wiring together
memory chips from two

1716
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:30,700
different rat brains to see if
they can really get to the

1717
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:34,450
point where a rat can
say, I know Kung Fu.

1718
01:08:34,450 --> 01:08:37,560
Now there are many, many,
many hurdles to this.

1719
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:40,479
Voluntary brain surgery is
not that common yet.

1720
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:42,399
It's going to be a while
until it's good enough.

1721
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:43,470
And there's questions.

1722
01:08:43,470 --> 01:08:44,479
What if it crashes?

1723
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:45,899
I mean, no computers
are perfect.

1724
01:08:45,899 --> 01:08:47,040
What if you get a virus?

1725
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,840
No computers are
totally secure.

1726
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:50,930
What if you get malware
or a phishing scam?

1727
01:08:50,930 --> 01:08:52,750
Those are all very
good questions.

1728
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:54,000
But I think the biggest
questions

1729
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,310
actually are societal.

1730
01:08:55,310 --> 01:08:57,686
Who gets to control
this technology if

1731
01:08:57,686 --> 01:08:58,450
it's in your head?

1732
01:08:58,450 --> 01:08:59,760
Is it a bottoms up thing?

1733
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:00,790
Can we hack it ourselves?

1734
01:09:00,790 --> 01:09:01,649
Do we own the data?

1735
01:09:01,649 --> 01:09:02,939
Or is it top down--

1736
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:03,779
imposed on us.

1737
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:06,220
Can someone snoop on our
thoughts or worse?

1738
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:08,660
So those are the fun questions
I get to attack in the novel.

1739
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:09,590
I hope you'll check it out.

1740
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:14,270
And I look forward to a true
super Google I/O one day.

1741
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:15,133
Thank you.

1742
01:09:15,133 --> 01:09:18,590
[APPLAUSE]

1743
01:09:18,590 --> 01:09:20,540
BRADY FORREST: Thank
you very much, Mez.

1744
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:23,140
And that concludes Ignite.

1745
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:24,779
Thank you all for coming.

1746
01:09:24,779 --> 01:09:27,899
Thank you Google for
hosting us again.

1747
01:09:27,899 --> 01:09:31,359
And you can find these videos
later at Ignite show and on

1748
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:32,479
our Twitter feed.

1749
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:33,729
Cheers.

1750
01:09:33,729 --> 01:09:37,687
