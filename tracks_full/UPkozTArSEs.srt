00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,190

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,810
LOUIS GRAY: Welcome back to
Google Developers Live at I/O.

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,890
I'm Louis Gray, here with my
special guest, Chris Wilson

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,350
from the Google Chrome team.

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:13,900
Welcome, Chris.

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,150
CHRIS WILSON: Thanks, Louis.

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,230
LOUIS GRAY: Chris, this
is a special treat.

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,170
We both get to stand
up a little bit.

9
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,890
And we're going to talk
about some fun things,

10
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,490
including Web Audio.

11
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,115
We've had you on Google
Developers Live a

12
00:00:23,115 --> 00:00:23,410
couple of times now.

13
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,680
CHRIS WILSON: You have,
actually, to

14
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,500
talk about Web Audio.

15
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,300
LOUIS GRAY: Talk about
Web Audio.

16
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,200
I mean, this is really a
specialty and a passion for

17
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:28,460
you, as you've told me.

18
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,010
CHRIS WILSON: Yes.

19
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,880
Yes, it is definitely
a passion in my

20
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,970
personal life, too.

21
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,810
So I kind of carried that
over into my work life.

22
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,740
LOUIS GRAY: And you live
up in Seattle, right?

23
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,070
CHRIS WILSON: I do currently.

24
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,840
Although I'm in the process
of moving down here.

25
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,120
LOUIS GRAY: Seattle's kind of
appropriate, where you let

26
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,550
your hair down--

27
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,050
CHRIS WILSON: Exactly.

28
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,040
LOUIS GRAY: --get
the guitar out.

29
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,170
So it all just kind of
works very smoothly.

30
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,380
CHRIS WILSON: Get the whole
grunge look going, and we'll

31
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,750
see how it works down here.

32
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,550
LOUIS GRAY: Absolutely.

33
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,000
So on the Chrome team, we really
talk about three things

34
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,620
most of the time.

35
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,340
And it's speed.

36
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,560
It's simplicity.

37
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,800
And it's security.

38
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,120
CHRIS WILSON: Yes.

39
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,580
LOUIS GRAY: But with the Web
Audio, you're also trying to

40
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,010
make the web do more.

41
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:57,380
CHRIS WILSON: Absolutely.

42
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,390
LOUIS GRAY: Tell me a little
bit about what's

43
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,580
going on with Web Audio.

44
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,330
CHRIS WILSON: So one of the
goals with Web Audio was first

45
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,850
to make it so that we could do
really good audio for gaming,

46
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,310
for any kind of interactive
application where you wanted

47
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,920
to be able to precisely
time things.

48
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,370
You hit the Fire button, you
don't want to hear it sometime

49
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:13,810
in the future.

50
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,860
You want to hear it right when
you hit the Fire button.

51
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,320
You want to be able
to do all kinds of

52
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,720
processing on that too.

53
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,605
And you want to be able to
synchronize things together,

54
00:01:21,605 --> 00:01:23,530
too, which has been really
hard to do in the web

55
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,360
platform, prior to Web Audio.

56
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,890
And now with Web Audio, you
can actually do that.

57
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,890
We also have a really powerful
processing system.

58
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,600
So you can do reverb and another
convolution effects.

59
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,920
You can do filtering effects.

60
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,370
You can place things in a 3D
sound field, and all kinds of

61
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,940
other neat stuff that is really
interesting for gaming,

62
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,330
of course, like all
those things.

63
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,240
Immersive games really need
those kinds of features.

64
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,060
But you also really want the
ability to do more than that

65
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,610
for kind of regular digital
audio workstation synthesis

66
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,460
kind of stuff as well.

67
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,540
LOUIS GRAY: Like professional
musicians and

68
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,240
that kind of stuff.

69
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,380
When you look at the verticals
that are here, not only games,

70
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,060
but what other type of people
are really going to be looking

71
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,660
at Web Audio as a solution
for them?

72
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,260
CHRIS WILSON: Exactly.

73
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,290
Well, I think that gaming, first
and foremost, was what

74
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,199
we had to hit just to begin,
just to get off the ground.

75
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,610
And now we're starting to carry
over into some of these

76
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,930
more professional audio
applications.

77
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,370
And we're starting to see a lot
of people come out of the

78
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,400
woodwork and start building
applications that do things

79
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,060
like drum machines, and
synthesizers, and other

80
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,800
processing type stuff as well.

81
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,210
And that's really I think what
I'm here to talk about today,

82
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:31,170
is kind of where we've come
since last year at I/O. Last

83
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,180
year at I/O, I gave a talk
about Web Audio--

84
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,740
still up on YouTube of course.

85
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,860
Got tons of great information.

86
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,610
I think almost all of that is
still completely relevant and

87
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,630
really a great--

88
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,200
LOUIS GRAY: But since then,
we've introduced new APIs.

89
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:43,670
CHRIS WILSON: We
have, actually.

90
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,480
LOUIS GRAY: We've made phones
stronger, faster.

91
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,180
And I think you actually bought
a couple demos for us.

92
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:48,620
CHRIS WILSON: I did.

93
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,140
LOUIS GRAY: Maybe you can
introduce us to what this demo

94
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:50,860
is all about.

95
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,240
CHRIS WILSON: Sure.

96
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,280
LOUIS GRAY: And let's get
the instruments out.

97
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,540
You didn't bring a drum
machine, did you?

98
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,100
CHRIS WILSON: I didn't bring a
drum machine, although I do

99
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,630
have a drum machine app
on my demos page.

100
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:57,950
LOUIS GRAY: No doubt.

101
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:58,850
CHRIS WILSON: So you
can check it out.

102
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:02,070
But one of the things I wanted
to start with was when I did

103
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,670
the Web Audio talk
last year, I was

104
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,260
exploring the API myself.

105
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,950
And what I did to explore it
was I built a vocoder.

106
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:13,610
And for anybody who remembers
kind of early '80s synth rock,

107
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,700
a vocoder is like the robotic
voice effect.

108
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,700
So you got this, really it's
a processing effect.

109
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,615
I'm not into tons of details.

110
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:21,035
LOUIS GRAY: Sort of Kraftwerk
to information society.

111
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:22,980
CHRIS WILSON: Exactly.

112
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,270
LOUIS GRAY: I like that stuff
way too much, to be honest.

113
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,760
CHRIS WILSON: The domo arigato
thing, that was all vocoding.

114
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,130
And so vocoding, takes a
frequency analysis of one

115
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:31,960
audio sound.

116
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,410
And it maps that frequency
analysis over time under a

117
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,230
different audience sound.

118
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,260
And I did this demo as
part of my talk.

119
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,580
And I didn't go into a ton of
depth, because there was a lot

120
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,215
of code that I built for it.

121
00:03:42,215 --> 00:03:44,710
But one of the exciting things
that I was really hoping we

122
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,070
would get in before I/O last
year, but it missed.

123
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,250
We were in summer I
think, midsummer,

124
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,560
before we got it in--

125
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,030
was audio input.

126
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,130
So not only can you generate
these sounds on the computer--

127
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,900
play back pre-recorded audio
snippets or build things with

128
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,150
synthesis--

129
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,570
but you can actually get audio
input from the computer.

130
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,550
LOUIS GRAY: From live
audio, as well.

131
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,110
CHRIS WILSON: Exactly.

132
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,440
So you can get the microphone on
your computer or any other

133
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,190
audio source that's
plugged into it.

134
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:09,644
LOUIS GRAY: And I understand
you brought an

135
00:04:09,644 --> 00:04:09,770
audio source today.

136
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,330
CHRIS WILSON: You can use
that and process it.

137
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,320
I did.

138
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:12,370
LOUIS GRAY: Let's see it.

139
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,850
CHRIS WILSON: I brought a couple
of them, actually.

140
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,890
So we're going to start, I want
to show-- the vocoder was

141
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:20,450
the first app that I was like,
as soon as I got a build from

142
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,800
the developer, I was like,
oh I got to go add this.

143
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,910
And like my wife was there
making dinner.

144
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,850
And I'm like yeah, don't
bother me right now.

145
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,550
I'm busy.

146
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,120
I'm busy.

147
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,080
So I got this up and running
in about 20, 25 minutes.

148
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,360
And basically I took this audio
vocoder that I built,

149
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,790
which could work off of a
preprocessed sound source.

150
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:43,620
So let's play and you can hear
of what it sounds like.

151
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,840
LOUIS GRAY: You're playing that
off the computer now.

152
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,860
CHRIS WILSON: And we're
playing it off the

153
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,650
computer right now.

154
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,040
So this is all being--

155
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,440
I prerecorded myself talking and
then applied the vocoding

156
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,020
effect to it.

157
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,260
So now, I can take this and
just click my little live

158
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,100
input button.

159
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,010
And I have a live
audio source.

160
00:04:59,010 --> 00:04:59,350
LOUIS GRAY: Are you going
to sing for us?

161
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,080
CHRIS WILSON: Check the
microphone, right here.

162
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,900
I'm not going to sing for you.

163
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,510
I actually told one of my
coworkers, singing--

164
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,540
not really something I'm
prepared to do yet.

165
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:08,750
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

166
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,660
No singing today.

167
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,180
Sorry guys.

168
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,050
CHRIS WILSON: Sorry,
not this time.

169
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,470
So one of the things that we do
here of course, is we have

170
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,310
to ask, is it OK if we use
your audio input source?

171
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,810
Because we don't want to let any
random web page pop up and

172
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,070
say, oh sure, you can listen
in to all of your users.

173
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,170
LOUIS GRAY: Oh, absolutely.

174
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:25,730
Permission first.

175
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,160
Security.

176
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,230
CHRIS WILSON: So permission
first.

177
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,010
Security is always
the theme here.

178
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,770
But now you can tell, I actually
have this vocoder

179
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,210
effect on my voice.

180
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,110
Everything that I say is running
through this vocoding

181
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,480
processing effect.

182
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,360
And by the way, all of the code
that I'm doing here--

183
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,290
and maybe we should stop doing
vocoding effect, because it's

184
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,710
probably a little
bit distracting.

185
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,460
We could use this for the
rest of the talk.

186
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,920
LOUIS GRAY: Sure.

187
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,380
CHRIS WILSON: But all of this
processing is actually being

188
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,560
done by the Web Audio API.

189
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,910
My own code actually
just sets up this

190
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,640
whole network of nodes.

191
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,400
And then the audio processing
API does everything.

192
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,980
The only bit of my JavaScript
code that's running right now

193
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,770
is the stuff that animates that
neat little visual effect

194
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,570
on the screen.

195
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:11,580
So the next thing though, like
the next thing that I built

196
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,460
after I added this into the
vocoder, was just started

197
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,580
playing with some
input effects.

198
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,980
LOUIS GRAY: And which
input is this?

199
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,560
CHRIS WILSON: So this is still
pulling off the microphone.

200
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,070
And it's just a few simple
effects, like delay.

201
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,680
But I'm going to turn this
off for a second.

202
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,210
And one of the things that is
really important to understand

203
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,910
is that input isn't
just microphones.

204
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,460
It's not just the mic that's
plugged into your computer.

205
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,390
So what I've got hooked up here
is just a standard USB

206
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,880
audio input.

207
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,330
But I have the ability
to plug-in

208
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,990
different audio sources.

209
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:53,560
And I brought along
my trusty guitar.

210
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,480
LOUIS GRAY: That's
a nice guitar.

211
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:54,980
Are you going to
show everybody?

212
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,290
CHRIS WILSON: It is
a nice guitar.

213
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,150
This is my baby.

214
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,460
This is one of my babies.

215
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,340
This is my electric baby.

216
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:05,120
But so what I've got
running off here--

217
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,120
and I'm going to pick a
different sound here, just so

218
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,250
we can see it.

219
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,060
What I've got running here is
just a regular, quarter-inch

220
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,290
output out of my guitar, run
straight into the USB audio.

221
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,660
In fact, I can change
the effect mix here.

222
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,690
And you can hear what
it sounds like.

223
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,030
It's kind of twangy.

224
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:24,170
It's standard kind of thing.

225
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,870
But if I crank the effects mix
up, what you'll hear is me

226
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,670
playing running through effects
that are all being

227
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:31,550
done in Web Audio.

228
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,280
I just set up a bunch of nodes
to do various things in here.

229
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,650
So this is my bass effects.

230
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,500
I didn't want to bring my bass
along because that was way too

231
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,750
much to take on the plane.

232
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:46,600

233
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,210
LOUIS GRAY: And while you're
doing that, we can all see the

234
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,880
visual running through the
computer at the same time.

235
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,290
CHRIS WILSON: Yeah.

236
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:53,190
So I've already talked about one
of the first things we had

237
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,500
to do was this precise
timing of audio.

238
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,920
We had to give you the ability
to precisely schedule things,

239
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,560
set them up, synchronize them,
do things together.

240
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,580
And I've got a bunch of other
really great stuff too that I

241
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,980
don't want to get into today,
because it takes a while.

242
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,430
But there's lot of powerful
stuff you can do with that

243
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,580
scheduling.

244
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,000
And then we added all this
processing stuff.

245
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,840
Like the things you're seeing
here are all filters and

246
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,580
convolution effects, distortion
using wave shaping,

247
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,510
and things like that.

248
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:24,580
But the last thing that the Web
Audio API really has is a

249
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,220
great ability to do analysis,
like we have built in

250
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,210
FFT-based frequency analysis.

251
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:30,800
LOUIS GRAY: What kind
of analysis?

252
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,799
CHRIS WILSON: So you can
actually see as I'm playing

253
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,940
here, this is a frequency
break down.

254
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,150
In fact, I can switch this
to just a straightforward

255
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,230
frequency graph.

256
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:43,309
And you can see the rich
harmonics because this wah

257
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:46,520
bass effect is actually trimming
off all the higher

258
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,010
frequencies.

259
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:51,080
It clips all the stuff that's on
there to the right, because

260
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,250
of course, lower frequencies
are on the left here.

261
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:53,930
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

262
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,340
CHRIS WILSON: But if I switch to
something else, like just a

263
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,610
distorted effect, you can see
the distorted effect has lots

264
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,450
of high-end energy.

265
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,980
And this is all being done, all
of the analysis of this is

266
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,280
being done, by the
Web Audio API.

267
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,450
So I have code of course, that
goes in and pulls the numbers

268
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,410
out and draws them
on the screen--

269
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,610
draws them on an HTML5 canvas.

270
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,720
But I'm not actually having to
do the processing of the bits

271
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,646
in JavaScript.

272
00:09:18,646 --> 00:09:20,460
LOUIS GRAY: A lot of this, this
is programs that you've

273
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,080
written based on the
Web Audio API.

274
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,960
Now, a couple of questions.

275
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,000
Number one, is the Web Audio API
always available in every

276
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,760
Chrome install, or is
it something else

277
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,610
you have to go get?

278
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,030
CHRIS WILSON: It's
a great question.

279
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,730
The Web Audio API is actually
available in

280
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:34,850
Chrome across the board.

281
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,370
It's not something
you need to add.

282
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,950
As I showed before, you do have
to, your users have to

283
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:42,140
allow microphone input,
live audio input.

284
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:46,850
They have to say it's OK to be
able to get access to that.

285
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:47,835
LOUIS GRAY: And then the second
thing I was going to

286
00:09:47,835 --> 00:09:50,390
ask is, how do developers
get started with this?

287
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,570
If there's somebody who really
wants to either look through

288
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,380
the Web Audio API to add it to
their games, or find some

289
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,540
other way to manipulate sound,
what do they do?

290
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,870
CHRIS WILSON: I think
there are a lot of

291
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,890
demos out there now.

292
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,590
There's a lot of code
out there now.

293
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,230
All of these things
by the way, are on

294
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,480
webaudiodemos.appspot.com.

295
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,030

296
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,190
You actually just search
for Web Audio demos.

297
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,570
This comes up.

298
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,260
LOUIS GRAY: It can
be number one.

299
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,470
CHRIS WILSON: This is
number one, I think.

300
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,990
I'm pretty sure this is
still number one.

301
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,310
LOUIS GRAY: In all
major engines.

302
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:14,940
CHRIS WILSON: Yes.

303
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,880
And this has a whole
bunch of my demos.

304
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,710
You can see most of these
have a link to

305
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,060
the Repro and GitHub.

306
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,610
These are all open
source stuff.

307
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:27,930
You can take it in and do
whatever you want with it.

308
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:31,240
But I forgot where
I was going now.

309
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:31,710
LOUIS GRAY: You were
talking about how

310
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,470
we're going to develop.

311
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,520
You said it's on GitHub.

312
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,600
You can find it at web.appspot.

313
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,340
Yeah.

314
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,000
CHRIS WILSON: The one thing I
did want to say is, one of the

315
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,900
other things and I'm really
excited about this year is

316
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,750
we're just on the cusp of
getting all this stuff into

317
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,880
Chrome for Android.

318
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,260
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

319
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:43,870
I was going to ask
about mobile.

320
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,890
Yes.

321
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,530
CHRIS WILSON: We're starting to
get all of this processing

322
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,630
power on the web platform on
mobile devices as well.

323
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,370
LOUIS GRAY: Interesting.

324
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,250
CHRIS WILSON: This is a much
more challenging thing to do,

325
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,380
because there's a broad spectrum
of devices and audio

326
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,560
hardware and those devices.

327
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,880
LOUIS GRAY: But there's been
some of that simplicity.

328
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,640
CHRIS WILSON: But it's
super powerful.

329
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,740
LOUIS GRAY: You had Android
studio, that just came out

330
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,870
which is going really help
people be able to code Android

331
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,730
applications against many
different models and types and

332
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,850
see how that works.

333
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:10,440
And as you look in Chrome,
Chrome came off Android not

334
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,140
too long ago.

335
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,010
It's out on IOS as well now.

336
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,050
And it's very interesting to
see that once you start

337
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,900
writing for a specific platform,
and that platform

338
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,920
becomes available to different
people on different operating

339
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,030
systems and different handsets,
it's just really

340
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:22,400
ubiquitous.

341
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,080
And it's available everywhere.

342
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,780
CHRIS WILSON: Exactly.

343
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,170
That's really the thing had me
really excited about Web Audio

344
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,970
from the beginning, was the idea
that eventually, we would

345
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,130
get this everywhere.

346
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,630
We would get it as a ubiquitous
platform.

347
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,840
I don't need to have a
particular device.

348
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,950
I actually, as I've been
preparing to move, I've been

349
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,210
packing up my studio.

350
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,640
And I've had to think through
each piece like, am I really

351
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,060
going to need this anymore?

352
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,660
Because by the time I unpack,
I could rebuild a bunch of

353
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,970
this stuff just as
Web Audio APIs.

354
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:53,630
And I don't really
need to drag the

355
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,160
hardware around anymore.

356
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:55,450
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

357
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,070
CHRIS WILSON: Like what I
brought here with me today,

358
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,940
what I brought with me down to
I/O, was basically just a USB

359
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,780
audio input, one microphone,
one guitar, and no effects

360
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,170
boxes or anything like that.

361
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:05,630
LOUIS GRAY: Awesome.

362
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,320
CHRIS WILSON: And I can still
there are tons of neat stuff.

363
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,800
LOUIS GRAY: Thank you for
bringing all that stuff over.

364
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,010
Thanks for joining us
with your guitar--

365
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:10,350
CHRIS WILSON: Thank
you for having me.

366
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,720
LOUIS GRAY: --and all
of your equipment.

367
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,830
It seems like we ran really
fast through this.

368
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,340
So I definitely want
people to check out

369
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,890

370
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,480
CHRIS WILSON: Webaudiodemos.

371
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,190
LOUIS GRAY: Webaudiodemos,
thank you--

372

380
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,800
