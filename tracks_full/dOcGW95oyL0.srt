00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,590
On the web, speed matters
because if your website's

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,900
slow, customers are going
to go elsewhere.

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,970
Now with PageSpeed Service,
speeding up

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,090
your website is easy.

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,310
PageSpeed works by taking the
stuff that people look at the

6
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,220
most then optimizing it using
Google's technology.

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,010
So everything is faster.

00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,040
Adding PageSpeed is easy.

00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,440
It takes only a few minutes.

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,880
And you don't have to know
anything about code, only that

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,710
being faster means more clicks,
more exploring, and

12
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,000
more people staying engaged on
your site, which adds up to

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,630
